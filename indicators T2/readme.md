# Indicators T2

This folder is used to store the Microsoft Word authoring template for each indicator. When any Word file is uploaded or updated here, a pull-request will be generated to convert the change into source translation (*.pot) files.

**This folder contains only tier 2 SDG indicators.** Tier 1 indicators (excluding pilot indicators) can be found under sdg-metadata/indicators/...

All files must be named according to the indicator id, using dashes. For example:

1-1-1.docx
1-2-1.docx
etc...
