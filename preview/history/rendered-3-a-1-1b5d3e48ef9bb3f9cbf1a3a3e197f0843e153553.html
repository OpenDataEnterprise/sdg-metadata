<p>Raw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used to calculate comparable estimates for this indicator. Information from subnational surveys are not used. </p>
<p><del class="diffdel">While less than 1 in 5 countries are currently reporting on all types of tobacco use, three-quarters of countries have robust data on tobacco smoking. Until the majority of countries are reporting on all types of tobacco use (smoked and smokeless), this indicator will be populated with tobacco smoking rates. </del>In some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;where other forms of tobacco are also being consumed</ins>, smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree. </p>
<p>The comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the estimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age ranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different tobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country&#x2019;s perception of which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored simultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of e-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries&#x2019; definitions of tobacco use. The definition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, surveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use. </p>
<p>There is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use. WHO&#x2019;s Tobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve comparability of indicators across countries.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><h1>Methodology</h1>
<h2>Computation method:</h2>
<p>A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco <del class="diffmod">smoking</del><ins class="diffmod">use</ins> for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966&#x2013;976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from countries in the same UN sub-region. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population.</p>
<p>Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For countries with less than two surveys completed in different years since 1990, no estimate is calculated, since no trend can be determined. For countries with data from two or more<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;national</ins> surveys, data gaps, if any, are filled as described in the Computation Method.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Countries where no estimate can be calculated are included in regional and global averages by assuming their prevalence rates for men and women are equal to the average rates for men and women seen in the UN <del class="diffmod">sub-region</del><ins class="diffmod">subregion</ins><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> in which they are located.
