<p><strong><h2>Definition:</p></h2>
<p>Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of childbirths attended by professional health personnel. According to the revised definition<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> these are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated, trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent to: (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-1">1</sup><p> Definition of skilled health personnel providing care during childbirth: the 2018 joint statement by WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, ICM, ICN, FIGO and IPA available at <a href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/definition-of-skilled-health-personnel-providing-care-during-childbirth/">https://data.unicef.org/resources/definition-of-skilled-health-personnel-providing-care-during-childbirth/</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-1">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.
