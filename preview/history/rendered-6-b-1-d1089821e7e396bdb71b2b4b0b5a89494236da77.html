<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>The indicator assesses the percentage of local administrative units (as defined by the national government) that have an established and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management.</p>
<p>The indicator Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is currently being measured by the Proportion of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or policy for participation by service users/communities in planning program in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion and the Proportion of countries with high level of users/communities participating in planning programs in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion.</p>
<p><strong><h2>Concepts:</p></h2>
<p>Stakeholder participation is essential to ensure the sustainability of water and sanitation management options over time, e.g. the choice of appropriate solutions for a given social and economic context, and the full understanding of the impacts of a certain development decision. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure needs of all the community is met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.</p>
<p>Local administrative units refers to non-overlapping sub-districts, municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both urban and rural areas to be defined by the government. </p>
<p>Policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management would define a formal mechanism to ensure participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. </p>
<p>A policy or procedure is considered to be established if the mechanism for participation of local communities is defined in law or has been formally approved and published. It is considered to be operational if the policy or procedure is being implemented, with appropriate funding in place and with means for verifying that participation took place.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Water and sanitation&#x2019; includes all areas of management related to each of the targets under SDG 6, namely: water supply (6.1), sanitation and hygiene (6.2), wastewater treatment and ambient water quality (6.3), efficiency and sustainable use (6.4), integrated water resources management (6.5) and water-related ecosystems (6.6).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p><strong><h2>Computation method:</p></h2>
<p>The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) questionnaire provides information on whether there are &#x201C;clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users (e.g. households) and communities in planning programs&#x201D;. For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.</p>
<p>Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.g. Regional aggregations (REG_AGG)</div></div></div><p><strong><h2>Regional aggregates:</p></h2>
<p>For global and regional aggregates, the percentage of local administrative units that have a defined and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management will be averaged among countries, with each country&#x2019;s percent value weighted based on total country population for the data year, as a proportion of the global population.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><h1>Data availability</h1>
<p><strong><h2>Description:</p></h2>
<p><strong><em>Asia and Pacific</em></strong>: Most countries (at least 50% of the countries covering 60% of the population from the region)</p>
<p><strong><em>Africa</em></strong>: Some countries (approximately 50% of the countries covering 50% of the population from the region)</p>
<p><strong><em>Latin America and the Caribbean</em></strong>: Most countries (at least 60% of the countries covering 80% of the population from the region)</p>
<p><strong><em>Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan</em></strong>: Most countries (at least 60% of the countries covering 60% of the population from the region)</p>
<p>Please note that these reflect data on presence of policies and procedures for local participation at the national level. Data at the local administrative unit level is being collected through the current cycle of GLAAS and through administrative data that will be progressively included in the calculation of the indicator (cf. 7.1, 10.1, and 10.2).</p>
<h2>Time series:</h2>
<p>Time series of parameters under the indicator are available for 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. </p>
<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>
<p>This indicator will be generated by countries, thus no differences in global and national figures are expected.</p></div>
