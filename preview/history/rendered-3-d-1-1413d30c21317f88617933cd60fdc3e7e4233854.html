<p>The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted in 2005 and entered into force in 2007 (available at: <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf</a><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>) . </p>
<p>Under the IHR, States Parties are obliged to develop and maintain minimum core capacities for surveillance and response, including at points of entry, in order to early detect, assess, notify, and respond to any potential public health events of international concern.</p>
<p>Article 54 of the IHR request that States Parties and the Director-General shall report to the World Health Assembly on the implementation of these Regulations as decided by the World Health Assembly.</p>
<p>In 2008, the World Health Assembly, through the adoption of Resolution WHA61(2), and later on 2018 with the Resolution WHA71(15), decided that &#x201C;that States Parties and the Director-General shall continue to report annually to the Health Assembly on the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005), using the self-assessment annual reporting tool&#x201D;.</p>
<p>This SDG 3.d.1. indicator reflects the capacities State Parties of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) had agreed and committed to develop. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level (DOC_METHOD)</div></div></div><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>
<p>The IHR States Parties Annual reports uses specific standard reporting tool made available by WHO Secretariat in July 2018. (State Parties Annual Reporting Tool annual reports and other guidance, links and references available at: <a href="https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/">https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/</a>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>State Parties of IHR can use the on-line reporting tool, that reflects the questionnaire of the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool was published in July 2018. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tool consists of 24 indicators for the thirteen IHR capacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report and respond, including at points of entry, to public health risk and acute events of domestic and international concern. </p>
<p>For each of the 13 capacities, one to three indicators are used to measure the status of each capacity. Each indicator is based on five cumulative levels for annual reporting. For each indicator, the reporting State Party is asked to select which of the five levels best describes the State Party&#x2019;s current status. For each indicator, in order to move to the next level, all capacities described in previous levels should be in place. </p>
<p>WHO made available specific guidance and tool, related resources and links for IHR State Parties submit annually their reports as well specific web platform (e-SPAR available at: <a href="https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/">https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/</a><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>)</p></div>
