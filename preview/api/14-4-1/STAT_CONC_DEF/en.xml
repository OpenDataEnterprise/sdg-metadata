&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels measures the sustainability of the world&amp;apos;s marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish stock assessment science defines the long term sustainability of fish resources as their abundance is fished at the level that produces the maximum sustainable level. The basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries are set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
