&lt;h2&gt;Appendix 2: Example indicator scoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general question ascertain the applicability of the instruments to a State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Country A is a coastal State, port State and flag State with high levels of implementation of instruments to combat IUU fishing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Country B is a coastal State, port State and flag State with very low levels of implementation of instruments to combat IUU fishing, however it still scores some points for initiating the processes of becoming a party to certain agreements and base implementation of UNCLOS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Country C is a coastal State and port State but does not flag any vessels conducting fishing or fishing related activities. It is not a party to any of the agreements but has a high level of implementation of instruments to combat IUU fishing to which it is applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table on the next page shows hypothetical responses for this three countries, the scores that they achieve with these responses and finally the bands that these scores translate into.&lt;/p&gt;
