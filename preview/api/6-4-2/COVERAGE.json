The indicator can be disaggregated to show the respective contribution of different sectors to the country&#x2019;s water stress, and therefore the relative importance of actions needed to contain water demand in the different sectors (agriculture, municipalities and industry). </p>\n<p>At national level, water resources and withdrawal are estimated or measured at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, aquifers). It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of water demand management.</p>"}}
