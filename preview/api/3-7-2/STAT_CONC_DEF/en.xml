	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual number of births to females aged 10-14 or 15-19 years per 1,000 females in the respective age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adolescent birth rate represents the risk of childbearing among females in a particular age group. The adolescent birth rate (ABR) is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) for ages 15-19 years, a designation commonly used in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates. A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility, measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
