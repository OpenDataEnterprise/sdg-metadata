&lt;p&gt;Real GDP per employed person being a measure of labour productivity, this indicator represents a measure of labour productivity growth, thus providing information on the evolution, efficiency and quality of human capital in the production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth in a country can be ascribed to many factors, including increased employment and more effective work by those who are employed. This indicator casts light on the latter effect, therefore being a key measure of economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support the formulation of labour market policies and monitor their effects. They can also contribute to the understanding of how labour market performance affects living standards.&lt;/p&gt;
