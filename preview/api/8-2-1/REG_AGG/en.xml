	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the problem of missing data, the ILO designed several econometric models which are used to produce estimates of labour market indicators in the countries and years for which real data are not available. The employment data derived from the Trends Econometric Models (TEM) are used to produce estimates on labour productivity. These models use multivariate regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. For further information on the TEM, please refer to the technical background papers available at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
