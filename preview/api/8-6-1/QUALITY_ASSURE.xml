&lt;p&gt;Data consistency and quality checks regularly conducted for validation of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, data are reported to the ILO Department of Statistics through its annual questionnaire on labour statistics, by national statistical offices or other relevant national agencies. Data are also received in other cases through agreements between the ILO Department of Statistics and regional or national statistical agencies, or obtained through ILO processing of microdata sets of national household surveys. The primary source of the data as well as the repository where applicable are indicated in the relevant metadata and/or footnotes in ILOSTAT and in the SDG Indicators Global Database.&lt;/p&gt;
