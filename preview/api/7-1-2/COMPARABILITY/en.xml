	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be discrepancies between internationally reported and nationally reported figures. The reasons are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modelled estimates versus survey data point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use of different definitions of polluting (or previously solid) fuels (wood only or wood and any other biomass, e.g. dung residues; kerosene included or not as polluting fuels).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use of different total population estimate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimates are expressed as percentage of population using polluting (or solid) fuels (as per SDG indicator) as compared to percentage of household using polluting (or solid) fuels (as assessed by surveys such as DHS or MICS).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the estimates presented here, values above 95% polluting fuel use are reported as &amp;#x201C;&amp;gt;95%&amp;#x201D;, and values below 5% as &amp;#x201C;&amp;lt;5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
