&lt;p&gt;Learning outcomes from national school- or household-based learning assessments are not automatically comparable across countries unless they are linked by design. Learning outcomes from cross-national learning assessment are automatically comparable for countries which participated in the same cross-national learning assessments, but they are not comparable across different cross-national learning assessments without further analytical effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparability over time is possible if the assessment is designed with an adequate linking process between waves of administration. This is described in the note &amp;#x201C;4.1.1. UIS request for reclassification 20181001.docx.&amp;#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;
