The sampling design has been developed in order to achieve an uncertainty on the forest and vegetation cover parameters of +-2% at global level and +-4 at regional level. Remote sensing data systematically collected from 2000 will be used to generate annual series from 2000 to 2015. The satellite data will be analysed using Collect Earth.</p>\n<p>Collect Earth is a tool that enables data collection through augmented visual interpretation of high resolution imagery using Google Earth. In conjunction with Google Earth, Bing Maps and Google Earth Engine, users can analyse high and very high resolution satellite imagery and historical trends in vegetation. It can be used to collect data at the local, regional and global level and has been successfully used by many country partners (Papua New Guinea, Tunisia, Uruguay, others).</p>"}
