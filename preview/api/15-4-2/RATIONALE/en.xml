	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific mountain community recognizes that there is a direct correlation between the green coverage of mountain areas and their state of health, and as a consequence their capacity of fulfilling their ecosystem roles. Monitoring mountain vegetation changes over time provides an adequate measure of the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems. Monitoring the mountain &amp;#x201C;Green Cover Index&amp;#x201D; over time can provide information on the forest, woody and vegetal cover in general. For instance, its reduction will be generally linked to overgrazing, land clearing, urbanization, forest exploitation, timber extraction, fuelwood collection, fire. Its increase will be due to vegetation growth possibly linked to land restoration, reforestation or afforestation programmes.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
