The SDG Metadata Translation project has evolved over time. The initial pilot examined the feasibilty of computer-assisted translation into Russian of SDG metadata. At that time, translation was limited to only a few tier 1 metadata files for which the World Bank was custodian. 

During the subsequent phase of the project, efficiencies in process contributed to expansion of the project to include translation into Russian for all remaining tier 1 and tier 1/2 indicators. 

These efficiencies also allowed expansion of translation into other languages through collaborations with Statistics Canada and ECLAC. As the project grew in scope, greater collaboration with UNSD led to further efficiencies.

In the next phase of the project, we intend to harvest SDG metadata routinely from the SDG Lab (maintained by UNSD) to allow 1) translation of all tier 2 metadata and 2) efficient updating of previously translated metadata as needed.  

Selected presentations describing the project's status and plans are provided below. .
