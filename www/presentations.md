The SDG Metadata Translation project has evolved over time. The initial pilot examined the feasibilty of computer-assisted translation into Russian of SDG metadata. The project has since expanded to include all tier 1 SDG metadata. Translations are available in French and Spanish as well.

In the next phase of the project, we intend to harvest SDG metadata routinely from the SDG Lab (maintained by UNSD) to allow 1) translation of all tier 2 metadata and 2) efficient updating of previously translated metadata as needed.  

Selected presentations describing the project's status and plans are provided below. .
