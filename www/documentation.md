The SDG Metadata Translation pilot produced a series of [detailed papers](https://worldbank.github.io/sdg-metadata/pilot/documentation/) evaluating the use of computer-assisted methods to produce Russian translations. The protocol was intended to enable others to replicate the pilot for their own translation needs. 

At the conclusion of the pilot, the protocol was refined to accommodate finalization of the SDG Metadata Concepts agreed upon by the SDG SDMX Working Group of the Interagency Expert Group on SDGs. The protocol was also refined to improve automatic formatting of files.

The documents below provide a general **introduction** and **step-by-step instructions** to replicate the refined protocol. User and developer feedback is welcomed at <sdgmetadatatranslation@worldbank.org>.

* *Step-by-Step Instructions:*

  **Step 1:** [Prepare machine readable (and SDMX compliant) metadata files from Word documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8VJ5mRfXJ2rrJd9-2z6vnRhRHFxDxAHWVpJ7fyyxIM/edit?usp=sharing)
  * *[SDG metadata authoring template](https://github.com/sdmx-sdgs/metadata/raw/master/SDG_Metadata_Template.docm)*

  **Step 2:** [Generate and manage machine readable files in Github for translation in Weblate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15r3D29CslaFKDkIA7_rwyEjLw2Btg2OXWuTn9h6KDdU/edit?usp=sharing)
  
  **Step 3:** [Use Weblate to translate machine-readable files and access the output](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Msu8aOVTItkdFIhN6O0snmKRX1wrD7iaW818ssZncXA/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)
  
 *HINT: Adding metadata files for translation? Start with step 1. Translating metadata files? Start wtih step 3.
        Editing formatting? For English files, see step 1. For translated files, see step 3.*
