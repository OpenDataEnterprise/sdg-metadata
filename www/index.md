The purpose of this pilot is to translate metadata for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Tier 1 indicators into Russian using computer assisted translation tools. A low cost, efficient, and accurate method was needed to improve the transparency and accessibility of metadata for statistical capacity building.

Launched in January 2020, the pilot is the result of a collaboration by the World Bank Group under the ECASTAT Trust Fund in coordination with UNECE and ROSSTAT. In addition to providing translations within the initial scope of work, this project provides a detailed protocol that could be replicated in other languages for other translation needs.
