Rationale
The concept of working poverty is captured by combining poverty status with employment status, which aims to measure how many workers, despite being in employment, live in poverty. The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light on the relationship between household poverty and employment.
