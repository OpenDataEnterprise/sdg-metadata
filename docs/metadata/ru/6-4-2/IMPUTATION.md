## Treatment of missing values

* **At country level**

    If scattered data are available, a methodology will be developed with regards to inter- and extrapolation.
* **At regional and global levels**

    For the MDGs, latest values were used to obtain regional or global aggregates, even if not available for the same year. It is expected that through the baseline that will be produced for the SDG monitoring, data for more or less the same range of years become available.
