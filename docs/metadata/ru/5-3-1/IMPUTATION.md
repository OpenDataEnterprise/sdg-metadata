## Treatment of missing values
* **At country level**

    When data for a country are entirely missing, UNICEF does not publish any country-level estimate.
* **At regional or global levels**

    The regional average is applied to those countries within the region with missing values for the purposes of calculating regional aggregates only but are not published as country-level estimates.
