Rationale
As seen in Table 1, most of the criteria for defining slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing overlap. The three criteria of informal settlements are essentially captured in the definition of slums, which sustains the combination of both (slums/informal settlements). From the seven criteria of adequate housing, the three that are not covered by slums / informal settlements are affordability, accessibility and cultural adequacy. For the purpose of composing an indicator, affordability is the most relevant and easier to measure.   

Thus, in order to come up with a composite indicator, the metadata for the SDG Indicator 11.1.1 is proposing to group the definition of slums and informal settlements, to allow for comparison with MDGs, and add the element of affordability from the definition of adequate housing. 

In this regard, housing affordability is not only a key housing adequacy criterion, but is a suitable means of measuring inadequate housing in a more encompassing manner, as it remains a global challenge across different countries and income levels, with strong negative impact on urban inequality. 
The underlying principle is that household financial costs associated with housing should not threaten or compromise the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs such as, food, education, access to health care, transport, etc. Based on the existing method and data of UN-Habitat’s Urban Indicators Program (1996-2006), unaffordability is currently measured as the net monthly expenditure on housing cost that exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household.

Thus, Indicator 11.1.1 is expected to be a composite one, with the main components of slum/informal settlements’ and the added component of affordability defining inadequate housing. Table 1 details the proposed definition of Slum/Informal Settlements and Inadequate Housing as well as the respective measurements. 

Table 1 – Definition and measurement criteria for slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing

Slums / Informal Settlements | DEFINITION: As adopted in the MDG, household where the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following ‘household deprivations’: 1) Lack of access to improved water source, 2) Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, 3) Lack of sufficient living area, 4) Lack of housing durability and, 5) Lack of security of tenure). | MEASUREMENT [^12]: Security of Tenure:
* Proportion of households with formal title deeds to both land and residence.
* Proportion of households with formal title deeds to either one of land or residence.
* Proportion of households with agreements or any document as a proof of a tenure arrangement.

Adequate water:
A settlement has an inadequate drinking water supply if less than 50% of households have an improved water supply:
* household connection;
* access to public stand pipe;
* rainwater collection; with at least 20 liters/person/day available within an acceptable collection distance.

Access to sanitation:
A settlement has inadequate sanitation if less than 50% of households have improved sanitation:
* public sewer;
* septic tank;
* pour-flush latrine;
* Ventilated improved pit latrine.
The excreta disposal system is considered adequate if it is private or shared by a maximum of two households.

Structural quality of Housing and location: Proportion of households residing on or near a hazardous site. The following locations should be considered:
* housing in geologically hazardous zones (landslide/earthquake and flood areas);
* housing on or under garbage mountains;
* housing around high-industrial pollution areas;
* housing around other unprotected high-risk zones (e.g. railroads, airports, energy transmission lines).

Structural quality of the housing and permanency of the structure:
Proportion of households living in temporary and/or dilapidated structures. The following factors should be considered when placing a housing unit in these categories: 
* quality of construction (e.g. materials used for wall, floor and roof);
* compliance with local building codes, standards and bylaws.

Sufficient living area / Overcrowding:
* Proportion of households with more than two persons per room.

Inadequate housing | DEFINITION: Proposed to complement the slums/informal settlements measuring affordability of housing at the global level. | MEASUREMENT: Affordability: 
* Proportion of households with net monthly expenditure on housing exceeding 30% of the total monthly income of the household.
