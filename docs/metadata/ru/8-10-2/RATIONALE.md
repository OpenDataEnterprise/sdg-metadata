## Rationale

Access to formal financial services such as savings, insurance, payments, credit and remittances is essential to the ability of people—regardless of income level, gender, age, education or where they live—to manage their lives, build their futures, and grow their businesses. Having access to an account is an important starting point for people to access a range of financial services.
