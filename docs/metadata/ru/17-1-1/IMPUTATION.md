Treatment of missing values
The IMF plans to rely exclusively on officially reported data provided by the national authorities using the standard GFS questionnaire based on GFSM 2014 methodology. No country data estimates for missing values will be calculated by the IMF Statistics Department. Where country data are not available due to a lack of reporting to the IMF Statistics Department, we plan to engage in outreach to the national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed, to ensure that the key GFS series are reported.
