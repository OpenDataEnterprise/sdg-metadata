## Disaggregation

To compute this indicator sectoral data are needed. The indicator can be disaggregated to show the respective contribution of different sectors to the countryâ€™s water stress, and therefore the relative importance of actions needed to contain water demand in the different sectors (agriculture, municipalities and industry).

At national level, water resources and withdrawal are estimated or measured at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, aquifers). It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of water demand management.
