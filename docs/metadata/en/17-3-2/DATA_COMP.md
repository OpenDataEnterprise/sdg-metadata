# Methodology

## Computation Method

Personal remittances are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees. World Bank staff estimates on the volume of personal remittances data are used for gap-filling purposes. GDP data, sourced from the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI) database, are then used to express the indicator as a percentage of GDP.
