Concepts
Employed persons: All persons of working age who, during a short reference period such as a day or a week, performed work for others in exchange for pay or profit. 

Poverty Line: Threshold below which individuals in the reference population are considered poor and above which they are considered non-poor. The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita monetary requirements an individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic bundle of goods and services. For the purposes of this indicator, an absolute international poverty line of US$1.90 per day is used. 

Household in poverty: Households are defined as poor if their income or consumption expenditure is below the poverty line taking into account the number of household members and composition (e.g., number of adults and children). 

Working poor: Employed persons living in households that are classified as poor, that is, that have income or consumption levels below the poverty line used for measurement.
