Treatment of missing values
* At country level
Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the worldâ€™s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary. 
* At regional and global levels
Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation.
