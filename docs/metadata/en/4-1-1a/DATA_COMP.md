The number of children and/or young people at the relevant stage of education n in year t achieving at least the pre-defined proficiency level in subject s expressed as a percentage of the number of children and/or young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.

MPL <sub>t,n,s,</sub>  = MP <sub>t,n,s</sub> / P <sub>t,n</sub>

where:

MP <sub>t,n,s</sub> = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, who have achieved at least the minimum proficiency level in subject s.

P <sub>t,n</sub> = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.

n = the stage of education that was assessed

s = the subject that was assessed (reading or mathematics).
