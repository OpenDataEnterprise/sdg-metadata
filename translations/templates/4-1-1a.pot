"## Concepts\n"
"*Minimum proficiency level* is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain "
"(mathematics, reading, etc.) measured through learning assessments. Until "
"August 2018, there was no globally agreed definition on minimum proficiency "
"level. As an interim reporting strategy, the UIS has been reporting "
"according to the minimum proficiency level defined by each assessment.\n"
"\n"
"*Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment* \n"
"The table below shows the minimum proficiency levels for each learning "
"assessment by target grade/age and domain. Due to heterogeneity of "
"performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these "
"performance levels will be mapped to the globally-defined minimum "
"performance levels and policy descriptors, agreed upon in September 2018 "
"(see 4.1.1. UIS request for reclassification 2018.09.28.docx) that will "
"allow pedagogical linking. Once the performance levels are mapped, the "
"global education community will be able to identify for each country the "
"proportion or percentage of children who achieved at least minimum "
"proficiency levels.\n"
