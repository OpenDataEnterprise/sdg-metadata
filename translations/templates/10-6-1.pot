"The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different "
"international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United "
"Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, "
"the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction "
"and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African "
"Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American "
"Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability "
"Board.\n"
"\n"
"There is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and "
"\"developing\" countries or areas in the United Nations system. In common "
"practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern America, "
"Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered "
"\"developed\" regions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is "
"currently done according to the United Nations M.49 statistical standard "
"which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, "
"while an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these "
"terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations \"developed\" "
"and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and do not "
"necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular "
"country or area in the development process."

"## Computation method\n"
"\n"
"The computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting "
"rights data from their respective annual reports. The proportion of voting "
"rights is computed as the number of voting rights allocated to developing "
"countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of "
"membership is calculated by taking the number of developing country "
"members, divided by the total number of members."

"The United Nations is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its "

"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"Cross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different "
"membership of the institutions. Voting rights and membership in their "
"institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a structural "
"indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement "
"on new States joining as Members, suspension of voting rights, membership "
"withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes."
