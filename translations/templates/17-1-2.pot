"<h2>Definition: </h2>\n"
"<p>The precise definition of the indicator is the<em> Proportion of "
"domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes</em>. "
"Budgetary central government, described in <em>GFSM 2014</em> (paragraph "
"2.81) is an institutional unit of the general government sector "
"particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power "
"to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary "
"central government is often a single unit of the central government that "
"encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, "
"legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is "
"usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central "
"government&#x2019;s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and "
"controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means "
"of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, "
"departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, "
"legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central "
"government are not separate institutional units. This is because they "
"generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or "
"engage in transactions in their own right (see <em>GFSM 2014</em> paragraph "
"2.42). including references to standards and classifications, preferably "
"relying on international agreed definitions. The indicator definition "
"should be unambiguous and expressed in universally applicable terms. It "
"must clearly express the unit of measurement (proportion, dollars, number "
"of people, etc.).</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts: </h2>\n"
"<p>The key concepts and terms associated with the indicator are outlined in "
"<em>GFSM 2014</em>, as are the associated classifications. Revenue is "
"defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) and the associated classifications "
"are detailed in Chapter 5. Expenditure is also defined in Chapter 4 "
"(paragraph 4.21) while the associated detailed classifications and concepts "
"used for calculating this aggregate are outlined in Chapter 6 - 8.</p>"

"<p>Sources and data collection:</p>\n"
"<p>The actual and recommended sources of data for deriving this indicator "
"are the fiscal statistics reported to the IMF&#x2019;s Statistics "
"Department. These come from various agencies (Ministries of Finance, "
"Central Banks, National Statistics Offices, etc.) and are compiled "
"according to a standardized method for data collection: the annual GFS "
"Questionnaire. In the 2016 annual reporting cycle, 110 countries reported "
"the relevant series for monitoring indicator 17.1.2. For current "
"non-reporting countries that have demonstrated the capacity to compile and "
"report the relevant GFS revenue series, we are engaged in outreach to the "
"national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area "
"Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed. The steps "
"outlined above should allow, over time, for covering virtually the entire "
"IMF membership.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale and interpretation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Indicator 17.1.2 Proportion of domestic budgetary central government "
"expenditure funded by taxes supports an understanding of the extent to "
"which countries&#x2019; recurrent and capital outlays are actually covered "
"by domestic revenue mobilization in the form of taxation. The indicator, "
"which can be directly derived from GFS series reported by national "
"authorities to the IMF Statistics Department, will provide analysts with a "
"cross-country comparable dataset that highlights the relationship between "
"the executed national budget and the revenue/tax administration As outlined "
"in the Annex to Chapter 4 of GFSM 2014, a variety of indicators can be "
"observed or derived directly from the GFS framework, while others can be "
"derived using a combination of GFS with other macroeconomic data (i.e., "
"GDP). 17.1.2 will be derived using series that are basic to the GFS "
"reporting framework. This enhances the comparability of data across "
"countries and ensures establishing robust analytical findings to support "
"SDG monitoring using fiscal data. There are also complementarities with "
"Indicator 17.1.1, which facilitates an understanding of the &quot;tax "
"burden&quot;. Both indicators are important in relation to achieving "
"longer-term development objectives.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>At this time the IMF recommends no regional and global aggregates be "
"established. While we see no issues in terms of the feasibility and "
"suitability of 17.1.2 for cross-country comparisons, we question the "
"relevance of one single global indicator that combines data for advanced "
"economies with those of emerging market and low income countries. </p>\n"
"<p>For reporting this indicator, budgetary central government is considered "
"the most appropriate level of institutional coverage as it will encompass "
"all countries. In principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially "
"affect fiscal policies. However, for most developing and many emerging "
"market economies compiling data for the consolidated general government and "
"its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability "
"and/or timeliness of source data. A country may have one central "
"government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many "
"local governments, and the GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be "
"compiled for all such general government units. This reporting structure is "
"illustrated below:</p>\n"

"<p>Classification of the indicator into one of the following three "
"tiers:</p>\n"
"<p>We recommend that 17.1.2 remain classified as Tier 1: The indicator is "
"conceptually clear and standards are available. The underlying data are "
"regularly produced by countries, and there is current data available. From "
"the IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification description at <a "
"href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/\">https://"
"unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/</a>, a key criteria is "
"that &#x201C;data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per "
"cent of countries&#x201D;. The IMF GFS database, with 110+ regular annual "
"reporting countries using the same reporting format certainly meets this "
"key criteria. All IMF member countries produce revenue (and expenditure) "
"data for surveillance purposes. In the current (2017) round of soliciting "
"annual GFS series from countries, we have specifically encouraged those "
"countries that were non-reporters over the past few years to (at a minimum) "
"provide the key revenue and expenditure series needed to monitor 17.1.</p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>General government units have four types of revenue: (i) compulsory "
"levies in the form of taxes and certain types of social contributions; (ii) "
"property income derived from the ownership of assets; (iii) sales of goods "
"and services; and (iv) other transfers receivable from other units. Of "
"these, compulsory levies and transfers are considered the main sources of "
"revenue for most general government units (GFSM 2014 paragraph 5.1). These "
"four types of revenue are represented by the following aggregates: Taxes, "
"Social contributions, Grants, Other revenue. Similarly, the economic "
"classification of expense identifies eight types of expense incurred "
"according to the economic process involved. For example, compensation of "
"employees, use of goods and services, and consumption of fixed capital all "
"relate to the costs of producing nonmarket (and, in certain instances, "
"market) goods and services by government. Subsidies, grants, social "
"benefits, and transfers other than grants relate to transfers in cash or in "
"kind, and are aimed at redistributing income and wealth. The functional "
"classification of expense provides information on the purpose for which an "
"expense was incurred. Examples of functions are education, health, and "
"environmental protection. The detailed GFS classification structure used in "
"the annual questionnaire that is used by countries to report data allows "
"for sufficient disaggregation for compiling 17.1.2.</p>"
