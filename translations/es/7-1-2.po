"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and "
"technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and "
"technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population "
"reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. "
"&#x201C;Clean&#x201D; is defined by the emission rate targets and specific "
"fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included "
"in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household "
"fuel combustion.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for "
"cooking, categorized as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are "
"considered polluting and non-modern, while non-solid fuels are considered "
"clean. This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to "
"clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or "
"technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting "
"forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and "
"heating.</p>\n"
"<p>New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO (i.e. WHO Guidelines "
"for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights "
"the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately "
"protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical "
"recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and "
"technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. "
"These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and "
"discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the "
"home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. "
"cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology "
"combinations to ensure health benefits.</p>\n"
"<p>For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, "
"access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as "
"&#x201C;access to clean fuels and technologies&#x201D; rather than "
"&#x201C;access to non-solid fuels.&#x201D; This shift will help ensure that "
"health and other &#x201C;nexus&#x201D; benefits are better counted, and "
"thus realized.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<p>Primary household fuels and technologies, particularly for cooking, is "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Cooking, lighting and heating represent a large share of household "
"energy use across the low- and middle-income countries. For cooking and "
"heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, "
"biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, "
"stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such "
"inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with "
"high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient "
"fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths "
"annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and "
"malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting "
"clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some "
"circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which "
"achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and "
"adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean "
"and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal "
"access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently "
"taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies "
"for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms "
"part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary "
"General&#x2019;s Sustainable Energy for All initiative.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator uses the type of primary fuels and technologies used for "
"cooking, heating, and lighting as a practical surrogate for estimating "
"human exposure to household (indoor) air pollution and its related disease "
"burden, as it is not currently possible to obtain nationally representative "
"samples of indoor concentrations of criteria pollutants, such as fine "
"particulate matter and carbon monoxide. However epidemiological studies "
"provide a science-based evidence for establishing those estimates using "
"these surrogates.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for "
"cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy "
"needs. However, many households use more than one type of fuel and stove "
"for cooking and, depending on climatic and geographical conditions, heating "
"with polluting fuels can also be a contributor to household (indoor) air "
"pollution levels. In addition, lighting with kerosene, a very polluting and "
"hazardous fuel is also often used, and in some countries is the main fuel "
"used for cooking.</p>\n"
"<p>While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good "
"starting point for tracking household energy access for cooking fuel, it "
"also presents a number of limitations that will need to be addressed over "
"time. Currently there is a limited amount of available data capturing the "
"type of fuel and devices used in the home for heating and lighting. "
"Accordingly WHO in cooperation with World Bank, and the Global Alliance for "
"Clean Cook stoves, is leading a survey enhancement process with "
"representatives from country statistical offices and national household "
"surveying agencies (e.g. Demographic and Health Survey, Multiple Indicator "
"Cluster Survey, Living Standards Measurement Survey) to better gather "
"efficiently and harmoniously information on the fuels and technologies for "
"cooking, heating and lighting. This process is currently in the piloting "
"phase with expected rollout of the final household surveys questions (~6 "
"questions in total) expected in the coming year. These few questions will "
"replace and slightly expand the current set of questions commonly used on "
"national multipurpose surveys to assess household energy.</p>\n"
"<p>Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and "
"piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring "
"Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture the affordability and "
"reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7 "
"and harnesses the normative guidance in the WHO guidelines to benchmark "
"tiers of energy access. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for "
"Measuring Energy Access has already been published based on a broad "
"consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous "
"international agencies working in the field. A first Global Energy Access "
"Survey using this methodology has already been launched and is underway "
"expecting to yield results by early 2017.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. "
"The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about "
"800 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include "
"Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement "
"Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health "
"Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys.</p>\n"
"<p>Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural "
"population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel "
"model. The model only accounts for regions, countries and time as a spline "
"function, and estimates are restricted to values ranging from zero to one. "
"More details on the model are published elsewhere (Bonjour et al, "
"2013).</p>\n"
"<p>Estimates for countries with no available surveys were obtained as "
"follows:</p>\n"
"<p>When survey data is available for a country, the regional population- "
"weighted mean is used to derive aggregate estimates at a regional or global "
"level, however no country point estimate is given for that country is "
"reported.</p>\n"
"<p>Countries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) "
"of more than US$ 12,746.- per capita are assumed to have made a complete "
"transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic "
"energy source for cooking and the primary reliance on polluting (unclean) "
"fuels and technologies use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed as "
"zero for regional and global estimates.</p>\n"
"<p>For estimating the fraction of the population relying on clean fuels and "
"technologies for heating and lighting, the same methodology using survey "
"data to derive country estimates for a particular year will be used using "
"the same above mentioned assumptions.</p>"

"main user of cooking energy.</p>\n"
"<p>In addition, WHO&apos;s Household energy database includes country data "
"from thirty countries on the time spent by children collecting fuelwood and "
"water disaggregated by sex. With the improvements in data collection via "
