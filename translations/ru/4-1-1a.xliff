*Minimum proficiency level* is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain (mathematics, reading, etc.) measured through learning assessments. Until August 2018, there was no globally agreed definition on minimum proficiency level. As an interim reporting strategy, the UIS has been reporting according to the minimum proficiency level defined by each assessment.

*Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment*

The table below shows the minimum proficiency levels for each learning assessment by target grade/age and domain. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels will be mapped to the globally-defined minimum performance levels and policy descriptors, agreed upon in September 2018 (see 4.1.1. UIS request for reclassification 2018.09.28.docx) that will allow pedagogical linking. Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of children who achieved at least minimum proficiency levels.

## Computation method

The number of children and/or young people at the relevant stage of education n in year t achieving at least the pre-defined proficiency level in subject s expressed as a percentage of the number of children and/or young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.

MPL &lt;sub&gt;t,n,s,&lt;/sub&gt;  = MP &lt;sub&gt;t,n,s&lt;/sub&gt; / P &lt;sub&gt;t,n&lt;/sub&gt;

where:

MP &lt;sub&gt;t,n,s&lt;/sub&gt; = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, who have achieved at least the minimum proficiency level in subject s.

P &lt;sub&gt;t,n&lt;/sub&gt; = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.

n = the stage of education that was assessed

s = the subject that was assessed (reading or mathematics).</source>

## School Based

* **International Large Scale Assessments** are reported to the UIS by cross-national organisations (LLECE, PASEC, TIMSS, and PIRLS). Typically, Cross National Large Scale Assessment, either regional or international, define various performance levels, and report as well the mean and standard deviation. They choose as well one level as the cut-off point that defines what children/youth are below or above level.
* **National Large-Scale Assessments** either sample- or census- based. Countries should report the proportion of students by level of competency for each domain indicating as well the minimum proficiency level, when it is defined by the national assessment. EGRA and EGMA as reported by USAID or individual countries.

## Household Survey- Based

* MICS6: reported to the UIS by UNICEF
* Pal network: reported to the UIS by Pal network</source>

        <source>## Comments and limitations

Learning outcomes from national school- or household-based learning assessments are not automatically comparable across countries unless they are linked by design. Learning outcomes from cross-national learning assessment are automatically comparable for countries which participated in the same cross-national learning assessments, but they are not comparable across different cross-national learning assessments without further analytical effort.

Comparability over time is possible if the assessment is designed with an adequate linking process between waves of administration.  This is described in the note “4.1.1. UIS request for reclassification 20181001.docx.”</source>
