"<p>For the denominator, first priority is given to the latest revision of "
"World Population Prospects (WPP) produced by the Population Division, "
"Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations. In cases where "
"the numerator does not cover the complete de facto population, an "
"alternative appropriate population estimate is used if available. When "
"either the numerator or denominator is missing, the direct estimate of the "
"rate produced by the National Statistics Office is used. Information on "
"sources is provided at the cell level. When the numerator and denominator "
"come from two different sources, they are listed in that order.</p>\n"
"<p>In countries lacking a civil registration system or where the coverage of "
"that system is lower than 90 per cent of all live births, the adolescent "
"birth rate is obtained from household survey data and census data. "
"Registration data regarded as less than 90 per cent complete are "
"exceptionally used for countries where the alternative sources present "
"problems of compatibility and registration data can provide an assessment of "
"trends. In countries with multiple survey programmes, large sample surveys "
"conducted on an annual or biennial basis are given precedence over "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors "
"underlying it are essential for improving sexual and reproductive health and "
"the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial "
"agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth "
"very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of "
"complications or death during pregnancy and birth than their peers, and "
"their children are also at greater risk of morbidity and death than children "
"born to older women. Therefore, preventing births very early in a "
"woman&#x2019;s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and "
"reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, having children at an early age "
"curtails a woman&#x2019;s opportunities for socio-economic improvement, "
"particularly because young mothers are less likely to keep on studying and, "
"if she needs to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and "
"work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect "
"evidence of young people&#x2019;s access to health services since youth, in "
"particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in "
"access to sexual and reproductive health services.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Discrepancies between the sources of data at the country level are common "
"and the level of the adolescent birth rate depends in part on the source of "
"the data selected.</p>\n"
"<p>For civil registration, rates are subject to limitations which depend on "
"the completeness of birth registration, the treatment of infants born alive "
"but that die before registration or within the first 24 hours of life, the "
"quality of the reported information relating to age of the mother, and the "
"inclusion of births from previous periods. The population estimates may be "
"subject to limitations connected to age misreporting and coverage.</p>\n"
"<p>For survey and census data, both the numerator and denominator come from "
"the same population. The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth "
"omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling "
"variability in the case of surveys.</p>\n"
"<p>With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged "
"10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of "
"births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based "
"on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged "
"15-19 years are less likely to report first births before age 15 than women "
"from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20&#x2013;24 "
"years.</p>"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the "
"number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator is the "
"estimate of the exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The "
"computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and the "
"denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and "
"census data.</p>\n"
"<p>In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered "
"number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, "
"and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged "
"15-19 years.</p>\n"
"<p>In the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births "
"obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who "
"were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period "
"before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the "
"ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference "
"period. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the "
"reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth "
"histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of "
"last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of "
"the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding "
"the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator "
"for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for "
"under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some "
"countries with no other reliable data, the &#x2018;own-children&#x2019; "
"method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth "
"rate for a number of years before the census.</p>\n"

"<p>Estimates based on civil registration are only provided when the country "
"reports at least 90 per cent coverage and when there is reasonable agreement "
"between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Small "
"discrepancies might arise due to different denominators or the inclusion of "
"births to women under 15 years of age. Survey estimates are only provided "
"when there is no reliable civil registration. There might be discrepancies "
"on the dating and the actual figure if a different reference period is being "
"used. In particular, many surveys report rates both for a three-year and a "
"five-year reference period. For countries where data are scarce, reference "
"periods of more than five years before the survey might be used.</p>"
