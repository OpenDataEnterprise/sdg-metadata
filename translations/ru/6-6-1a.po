"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers "
"and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For "
"purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem "
"category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been "
"divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and "
"methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data "
"sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. "
"Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, "
"the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive "
"monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:</p>\n"
"<p>Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth "
"observations which will be validated by countries against their own "
"methodologies and datasets: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Sub-Indicator 1 &#x2013; spatial extent of water-related ecosystems "
"</li>\n"
"  <li>Sub-Indicator 2 &#x2013; water quality of lakes and artificial water "
"bodies</li>\n"
"  <li>Level 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:</li>\n"
"  <li>Sub-Indicator 3 &#x2013; quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and "
"estuaries</li>\n"
"  <li>Sub-Indicator 4 &#x2013; water quality imported from SDG Indicator "
"6.3.2 </li>\n"
"  <li>Sub-Indicator 5 &#x2013; quantity of groundwater within aquifers</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document "
"entitled, &#x201C;Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator "
"6.6.1&#x201D;.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on "
"existing international frameworks and glossaries unless where indicated "
"otherwise below.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Water-related ecosystems</em></strong> &#x2013; includes "
"five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, "
"4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this "
"methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category "
"terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in "
"Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and "
"estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator "
"6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as "
"these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories "
"of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured "
"within the ecosystem category of &#x2018;vegetated wetlands&#x2019;. </p>\n"
"<p>Vegetated Wetlands &#x2013; the water-related ecosystem category of "
"vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and "
"mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on "
"Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: &#x201C;areas of marsh, fen, "
"peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, "
"with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including "
"areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six "
"metres&#x201D; with the exception that salt waters are not included in "
"Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the "
"exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem "
"categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial "
"waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem "
"category because of their importance for target achievement and because the "
"methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from "
"other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will "
"also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention "
"on Wetlands.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Artificial Waterbodies</em></strong> &#x2013; the "
"water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open "
"waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines "
"and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water "
"ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they "
"hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Open Water</em></strong> &#x2013; as any area of surface "
"water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the following 3 "
"water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and "
"artificial waterbodies.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Extent</em></strong> &#x2013; has been expanded beyond "
"spatial extent to capture additional basic parameters needed for the "
"protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. Extent includes "
"three components: the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, and the "
"quantity of water-related ecosystems. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Change</em></strong> &#x2013; a shift from one condition of "
"extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, measured "
"against a point of reference.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 1:</em></strong> Open water spatial extent "
"data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, "
"has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards "
"(up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution "
"satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For "
"example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, "
"used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise "
"delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher "
"spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). "
"Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, "
"including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To "
"generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery "
"from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by "
"other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) "
"annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial "
"datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil "
"types. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 2</em></strong>: Chl and TSS lake observations "
"are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with "
"instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to "
"detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within "
"lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality "
"sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can "
"detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 3</em></strong>: The source of data for "
"monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in "
"situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also "
"acceptable. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 4</em></strong>: The source of data for "
"monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ "
"measurements within water-related ecosystems. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 5</em></strong>: The source of data for "
"monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in "
"situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled "
"data is also acceptable. </p>"

msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Target 6.6 aims to &#x201C;protect and restore water-related ecosystems, "
"including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes&#x201D; "
"through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these "
"ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different "
"components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture "
"that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of "
"water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to "
"support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and "
"thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is "
"proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized "
"methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive "
"spatial and temporal scale.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth "
"observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which "
"will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and "
"numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used "
"to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish "
"understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized "
"methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation "
"(GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and "
"the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for "
"Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to "
"provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only "
"measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to "
"determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. "
"However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of "
"pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local "
"assessments of water quality.</p>\n"
"<p>The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed "
"decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. "
"It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected "
"and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively "
"make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The "
"data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use "
"change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related "
"ecosystems.</p>"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is "
"comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related "
"Ecosystems</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>The methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations "
"are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related "
"ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different "
"land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect "
"different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, "
"capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the "
"globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined "
"to classify the site&#x2019;s land cover. Advanced computing technology can "
"be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land "
"cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any "
"area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in "
"the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can "
"be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. </p>\n"
"<p>To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further "
"processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other "
"datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into "
"lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, "
"vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to "
"detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach "
"which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture "
"and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture "
"Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial "
"datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the "
"watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting "
"datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of "
"vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the "
"calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to "
"prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. </p>\n"
"<p>Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology "
"annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of "
"artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These "
"national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. "
"Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change "
"of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent "
"five year averages are compared to this baseline. </p>\n"

"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water "
"bodies</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>The methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations "
"are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and "
"total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can "
"only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that "
"affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the "
"primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the "
"food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as "
"proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.</p>\n"
"<p>Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated "
"for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each "
"lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to "
"produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized "
"fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any "
"one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are "
"quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. </p>\n"
"<p>The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from "
"comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl "
"and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl "
"and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where "
"percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality "
"monitoring and management. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and "
"Estuaries</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>The methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques "
"for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These "
"techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The "
"methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique "
"because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, "
"terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as "
"well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by "
"countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected "
"at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an "
"annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. </li>\n"
"  <li>Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the "
"point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national "
"boundary. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per "
"basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be "
"averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage "
"change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins "
"must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate "
"percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To "
"calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period "
"following the reference period, the following formula is used:</p>\n"

"of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of "
"groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics "
"of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries "
"must adhere to the following minimum criteria:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be "
"collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to "

"<p>The methodology was tested in two pilot phases. The first of these "
"involved designing the methodology in consultation with countries resulting "
"in a first draft of the methodology which was reviewed and strengthened by "
"the Target Team. In early 2016, the draft methodology was pilot tested in "
"five countries between April and November 2016 through workshops: Jordan, "
"the Netherlands, Peru, Senegal, and Uganda. In each of these countries, "
"various participants from national entities and government sectors were "
"engaged to obtain wide feedback on the technical feasibility of the draft "
"methodology. </p>\n"
"<p>During the 2016 country pilots of the draft methodology, the NSO from "
"each of the 5 countries was consulted and engaged in the process. During "
"the 2017 pilot methodology data drive, the initial request for data was "
"communicated to all NSOs. In addition, in October 2017 national data on "
"spatial extent of open water (derived from earth observations) was shared "
"with 188 countries, directly via their NSOs (see further details above).</p>"
