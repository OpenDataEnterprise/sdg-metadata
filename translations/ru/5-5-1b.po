"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the proportion of positions held by women in "
"local government. It is expressed as a percentage of elected positions held "
"by women in legislative/ deliberative bodies of local government. </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts: </h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Local government</em></strong> is one of the sub-national "
"spheres of government and a result of decentralization, a process of "
"transferring political, fiscal, and administrative powers from the central "
"government to sub-national units of government distributed across the "
"territory of a country to regulate and/or run certain government functions "
"or public services on their own. </p>\n"
"<p>The definition of local government follows the 2008 System of National "
"Accounts (SNA) distinction between central, state, and local government "
"(para 4.129). Local government consists of local government units, defined "
"in the SNA as &#x201C;institutional units whose fiscal, legislative and "
"executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas "
"distinguished for administrative and political purposes&#x201D; (para "
"4.145). What constitutes local government of a given country is defined by "
"that country&#x2019;s national legal framework, including national "
"constitutions and local government acts or equivalent legislation.</p>\n"
"<p>Each local government unit typically includes a legislative/ "
"deliberative body and an executive body. <strong><em>Legislative/ "
"deliberative bodies</em></strong>, such as councils or assemblies, are "
"formal entities with a prescribed number of members as per national or "
"state legislation. They are usually elected by universal suffrage and have "
"decision-making power, including the ability to issue by-laws, on a range "
"of local aspects of public affairs. </p>\n"
"<p>Executive bodies, consisting of an executive committee or a mayor, may "
"be elected, appointed or nominated and they prepare and execute decisions "
"made by the legislative/ deliberative body. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Elected positions</em></strong> are the most common manner "
"of selection of local government members. They are selected in local "
"elections, based on a system of choosing political office holders in which "
"the voters cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that "
"they desire to see elected. The category of elected positions includes both "
"elected persons who competed on openly contested seats and persons selected "
"during the electoral processes on reserved seats or through a candidate "
"quota.</p>\n"
"<p>By comparison, members selected on appointed positions (the least common "
"manner of selection of local government members) are nominated, typically "
"by government officials from higher-ranking tiers of government. Appointed "
"members of local government are more frequent among the leadership "
"positions, such as the heads of the executive body, representatives of "
"specific groups (e.g., women, disadvantaged groups, youth); and, temporary "
"committees/delegations/caretakers appointed by government officials when a "
"council has been dissolved.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Administrative data based on electoral records</em></strong> "
"are the main source of data on elected members of local government, and the "
"recommended data source for Indicator 5.5.1(b). Electoral records are "
"produced and upheld by Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) or equivalent "
"bodies tasked with organizing elections at local level. EMBs are part of "
"the National Statistical System, and often specifically mentioned in the "
"national statistics acts as producers of official statistics. </p>\n"
"<p>The use of electoral records to measure women&#x2019;s representation in "
"local government and monitoring of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is cost-effective, "
"straightforward and timely. No adjustments or estimates are necessary to "
"transform the administrative information into statistics for monitoring the "
"indicator. The conceptual framework at the basis of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is "
"consistent with the conceptual framework at the basis of local elections, "
"as both are provided by national legal framework. The data used to "
"calculate Indicator 5.5.1(b) refer to information on election winners, "
"disaggregated by sex, and the coverage of the reference population (in this "
"case, the elected officials) should be complete. In countries where the "
"electoral records are electronic and centralized, information on numbers of "
"women and men in elected positions can be made available as soon as the "
"official results of elections are released. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Two other types of sources of data</em></strong> may be used "
"in the few instances where electoral records are not electronic or not "
"centralized. One additional type of source is also administrative, and "
"refers to public administration data available to line ministries "
"overseeing local government. However, its use for statistics may be less "
"straightforward compared to centralized electoral records. The scope of "
"public administration records is beyond the elected positions, and "
"information on women and men in elected positions of local government may "
"be mixed with information on public administration employees, which are not "
"covered by this indicator. Therefore, additional data processing and "
"resources may be required to carefully extract the information needed. In "
"some cases, the forms used as the basis for administrative records may need "
"to be modified to ensure recording of the positions as being elected, in "
"legislative/deliberative bodies, as well as the sex of persons in those "
"positions. In other cases, some elected positions may not be covered in the "
"records maintained, for example, if the administrative records are "
"restricted to only those positions that are on the government payroll. </p>\n"
"<p>Another type of data source that may provide information on women and "
"men in local government in the absence of centralized electronic election "
"records, refers to existing surveys or censuses using local government "
"units as units of observation. These surveys or censuses may be undertaken "
"by National Statistical Offices and/or line ministries and may take the "
"form of (a) local government censuses or surveys; (b) establishment survey; "
"and (c) municipality surveys. These surveys/census may already include, in "
"the data collection tool dedicated to their main purpose, a few questions "
"on the number of members of local legislative/deliberative and executive "
"bodies by sex and other individual characteristics such as age and "
"education; or may require the integration of such questions. Similar to "
"other censuses and surveys, a low response rate can result in bias of the "
"statistics obtained. Sampling errors may also add to the bias, in ways that "
"cannot be assessed in the absence of a good understanding of distribution "
"of women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s representation across different local "
"government units across the territory of a country.</p>"

"<p>Women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s right to exercise their political rights "
"on an equal basis, and at all levels of decision-making, is recognized in "
"the SDGs and enshrined in many human and political rights declarations, "
"conventions and resolutions agreed to by most countries in the world. "
"Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the degree to which gender balance has been "
"achieved in, and women have equal access to, political decision-making in "
"local government. </p>\n"
"<p>Indicator 5.5.1(b) complements the Indicator 5.5.1(a) on women in "
"national parliaments, and accounts for the representation of women among "
"the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have the "
"potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. "
"All tiers of local government are covered by the indicator, consistent with "
"national legal frameworks defining local government. </p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Indicator 5.5.1(b) refers to the representation of women among elected "
"positions of legislative/deliberative bodies of local government. This is a "
"strength, because it ensures comparability across countries, at low cost, "
"and mirrors the SDG indicator measuring women&#x2019;s representation at "
"national level, in parliament. This is also a limitation in that the "
"indicator does not consider other positions in local government. Local "
"government officials holding executive positions who are not simultaneously "
"holding a position within the legislative/deliberative body, or who are "
"appointed and not elected, are not considered in this indicator. </p>\n"
"<p>It is recommended that women&#x2019;s representation in executive "
"positions, particularly at the level of the head of the executive (such as "
"mayor), is monitored separately at national and global levels, but not as a "
"headline SDG indicator.</p>\n"
"<p>Importantly, the indicator refers to representation among members of "
"local government and not the quality of their participation. Countries may "
"therefore consider assessing political participation through national or "
"subnational studies involving qualitative and/or quantitative methods of "
"research. Additional indicators of political participation may also be "
"monitored at national level, such as women&#x2019;s share among voters and "
"candidates in local elections, to monitor the closing of other gaps on "
"women&#x2019;s political participation. </p>\n"
"<p>Finally, aspects of local governance beyond the formal institutions of "
"local government, such as public administration staff, are not included in "
"the indicator 5.5.1(b), and may be covered by other indicators in the SDG "
"framework, particularly within the Goal 16 on inclusive societies.</p>"
