"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international "
"instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated "
"fishing.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The definitions and concepts associated with the indicator and utilized "
"in the methodology are defined in the FAO term portal: <a "
"href=\"http://www.fao.org/faoterm/collection/fisheries/en/\">http://www.fao."
"org/faoterm/collection/fisheries/en/</a></p>\n"
"<p>This indicator is based on a country&#x2019;s implementation of the "
"different international instruments that combat illegal, unreported and "
"unregulated fishing (IUU fishing). IUU fishing undermines national and "
"regional efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks and, as a consequence, "
"inhibits progress towards achieving the goals of long-term sustainability "
"and responsibility as set forth in, inter alia, Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 and "
"the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Moreover, IUU "
"fishing greatly disadvantages and discriminates against those fishers that "
"act responsibly, honestly and in accordance with the terms of their fishing "
"authorizations. This is a compelling reason why IUU fishing must be dealt "
"with expeditiously and in a transparent manner. If IUU fishing is not "
"curbed, and if IUU fishers target vulnerable stocks that are subject to "
"strict management controls or moratoria, efforts to rebuild those stocks to "
"healthy levels will not be achieved. To efficiently curb the IUU fishing a "
"number of different international instruments have been developed over the "
"years that focus on the implementation of the different responsibilities of "
"States. </p>\n"
"<p>The instruments covered by this indicator and their role in combatting "
"IUU fishing are as follows:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong>The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea "
"(UNCLOS)</strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>This instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent instruments "
"are built upon. UNCLOS defines the rights and responsibilities of nations "
"with respect to their use of the world&apos;s oceans, establishing "
"guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine "
"natural resources. It is a binding instrument, although its principles may "
"also be applied by countries who are not party to it.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong>The Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the "
"United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 "
"Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and "
"Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement)</strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The UN Fish Stocks Agreement entered into force on 11 December 2001, and "
"is the most comprehensive of the binding international instruments in "
"defining the role of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and "
"elaborating measures that could be taken in relation to IUU fishing "
"activities. Although the UN Fish Stocks Agreement applies primarily to the "
"highly migratory and straddling fish stocks on the high seas, its broad "
"acceptance and application is evidenced by the reinforcement of other "
"international instruments, implementation at the regional level, and to "
"some extent by State practice within areas of national jurisdiction.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong>The International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and "
"Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing "
"(IPOA-IUU)</strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The objective of the IPOA is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing "
"by providing all States with comprehensive, effective and transparent "
"measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries "
"management organizations established in accordance with international law. "
"This instrument covers all the aspects of a State&#x2019;s responsibilities "
"including, flag State responsibilities, coastal State measures, port State "
"measures, internationally agreed market-related measures, research and "
"regional fisheries management organizations.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong>The 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, "
"Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing "
"(PSMA)</strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate "
"Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing entered into force on the 5th "
"of June 2016. The main purpose of the Agreement is to prevent, deter and "
"eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the "
"implementation of robust port State measures. The Agreement envisages that "
"parties, in their capacities as port States, will apply the Agreement in an "
"effective manner to foreign vessels when seeking entry to ports or while "
"they are in port. The application of the measures set out in the Agreement "
"will, inter alia, contribute to harmonized port State measures, enhanced "
"regional and international cooperation and block the flow of IUU-caught "
"fish into national and international markets.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong>The FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance "
"(VG-FSP)</strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance spell out a "
"range of actions that countries can take to ensure that vessels registered "
"under their flags do not conduct IUU fishing, including monitoring, control "
"and surveillance (MCS) activities, such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS) "
"and observers. They promote information exchange and cooperation among "
"countries so that flag states are in a position to refuse to register "
"vessels that are &quot;flag-hopping&quot; by attempting to register with "
"another flag state or to refuse vessels that have been reported for IUU "
"fishing. The Guidelines also include recommendations on how countries can "
"encourage compliance and take action against non-compliance by vessels, as "
"well as on how to enhance international cooperation to assist developing "
"countries to fulfil their flag state responsibilities.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong>The FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International "
"Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas "
"(Compliance Agreement)</strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement entered into force on the 24th of "
"April 2003. Its main purpose is to encourage countries to take effective "
"action, consistent with international law, and to deter the reflagging of "
"vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with "
"applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the "
"high seas. With respect to the role of RFBs, the preamble calls upon States "
"which do not participate in global, regional or sub regional fishery "
"organizations or arrangements to do so, with a view to achieving compliance "
"with international conservation and management measures.</p>"

"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The purpose of this indicator is to show a picture of the state of "

"Subsequent indicator estimates will then be able to show any progress made "
"by countries. </p>\n"
"<p>Although the exact score will be important from one reporting year to "

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is based upon responses by States to a certain sections of "
"the questionnaire for monitoring the implementation of the Code of Conduct "
"for Responsible Fisheries and related instruments (CCRF). These are "
"sections covering the implementation of different international instruments "
"used to combat IUU fishing. The responses will be converted using an "
"algorithm to obtain a score for the indicator. Each instrument will be "
"covered within a given variable, as follows:</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 1</strong> <strong>(V1)</strong> - Adherence and "
"implementation of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the "
"Sea</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 2</strong> <strong>(V2)</strong> - Adherence and "
"implementation of the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 3 (V3)</strong> - Development and implementation of a "
"national plan of action (NPOA) to combat IUU fishing in line with the "
"IPOA-IUU </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 4 (V4)</strong> - Adherence and implementation of the "
"2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA) </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 5 (V5)</strong> - Implementation of Flag State "
"Responsibilities in the context of the 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement and "
"FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance</p>\n"
"<p>Depending on responses by FAO Members on the adherence and "
"implementation of the above-mentioned instruments, States will score an "
"indicator value between 0 and 1. Each variable is given a weighting, which "
"takes into consideration the importance of the instrument in combating IUU "
"fishing as well as the overlap between the instruments. The variable "
"weightings are as follows:</p>\n"
