The use of PPPs rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price levels across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living below US$1.90 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the same degree of need.\n\nPoverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to households, and not to individuals. Based on the assumption that households pool their income, the question asked is whether a household’s total income is sufficient to ensure that it isn’t classified as being in poverty. The poverty status of a household is therefore a function of the wage and other employment-related income secured by those household members who work (plus any non-employment-related income such as transfer payments) and the number of household members. Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his or her own income, the income of other household members and the number of household members – for example, children – who need to be supported. It is thus often valuable to study household structure in relation to working poverty. For example, it may be relevant for some countries to assess the differences in working poverty rates between persons living in households whose members are unrelated individuals from those whose members are related.","ru":""}}
