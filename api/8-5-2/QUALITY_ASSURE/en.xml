Data also received in other cases through agreements between the ILO Department of Statistics and regional or national statistical agencies, or obtained through ILO processing of microdata sets of national household surveys. The primary source of the data as well as the repository where applicable are indicated in the relevant metadata and/or footnotes in ILOSTAT and in the SDG Indicators Global Database.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
