&lt;p&gt;This indicator has largely been successfully due to the collaborations between several organizations and institutions including UN- Habitat, UNEP, Cities Alliance, Slum dwellers International, and World Bank. There are several other experts who have also contributed to the development of the concepts, rationale and definitions, and metadata and will also support measurement, reporting and policy dialogue at the country level, based on the indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For primary reporting, National data provider especially the Statistical agencies will play an important role of generation of the primary data through census and surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
