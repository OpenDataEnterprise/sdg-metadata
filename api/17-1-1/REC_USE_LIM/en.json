Cross-country comparisons are ideally made with reference to the consolidated general government sector. However, for most developing and many emerging market economies, compiling data for the consolidated general government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability and/or timeliness of source data. For example, a country may have one central government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local governments. Countries may also have social security funds. The *GFSM 2014* recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such general government units. This reporting structure is illustrated below:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"9\">General Government</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"3\">Memorandum Central Govt. (incl. SSF of central level)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"4\">Central Government (excluding social security funds)</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Social Security Funds</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">State Governments</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Local Governments</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Consolidation Column</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">General Government</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Budgetary</td>\n    <td>Extrabudgetary</td>\n    <td>Consolidation Column</td>\n    <td>Central Government</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>BA=GL1</td>\n    <td>EA</td>\n    <td>CC</td>\n    <td>CG</td>\n    <td>SSF</td>\n    <td>SG</td>\n    <td>LG</td>\n    <td>CT</td>\n    <td>GG=GL3</td>\n    <td>GL2</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome countries report data for the consolidated general government with one or more sub-sectors not separately reported. Similarly, there are some countries that report “consolidated central government” without necessarily providing the budgetary central government subsector separately. Conceptually, a World Aggregate could be calculated by computing a weighted average from available sources using GDP expressed in United States dollars. However, at this time the IMF Statistics Department recommends no regional and global aggregates be established. While we see no issues in terms of the feasibility and suitability of 17.1.1 for cross-country comparisons, we question the relevance of one single global indicator that combines data for advanced economies with those of emerging market and low-income countries. To address this, the country data are presented, where reported, for the budgetary central government, the consolidated central government (with and without social security funds), and for consolidated general government. \n\nFor many emerging market and low-income countries with limited statistical capacity, budgetary central government is considered the most appropriate level of institutional coverage for comparison purposes. Budgetary central government, as described in *GFSM 2014* (paragraph 2.81), is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature."}
