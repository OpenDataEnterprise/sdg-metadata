&lt;p&gt;The global average density was estimated as the population weighted average of the national densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the regional average density, data for the countries with missing values in the period 2013-2018 were first estimated with neighbouring comparable countries. Then the regional average was also computed as a weighted average by pooling these estimated values plus the available national densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population for estimating densities at regional and global level were extracted from the UN Population Division 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
