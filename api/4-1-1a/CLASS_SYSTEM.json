Until August 2018, there was no globally agreed definition on minimum proficiency level. As an interim reporting strategy, the UIS has been reporting according to the minimum proficiency level defined by each assessment.\n\n*Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment* \nThe table below shows the minimum proficiency levels for each learning assessment by target grade/age and domain. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels will be mapped to the globally-defined minimum performance levels and policy descriptors, agreed upon in September 2018 (see 4.1.1. UIS request for reclassification 2018.09.28.docx) that will allow pedagogical linking. Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of children who achieved at least minimum proficiency levels.\n\n### Table 1.
