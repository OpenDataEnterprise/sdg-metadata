$$MPL_{t,n,s} = {MP_{t,n,s} / P_{t,n}}$$

where: 

$MPL_{t,n,s}$ = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, who have achieved at least the minimum proficiency level in subject s.

$P_{t,n}$ = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.

$n$ = the stage of education that was assessed

$s$ = the subject that was assessed (reading or mathematics).
