&lt;p&gt;UNESCO uses a triangulated method to compare data for global monitoring, which includes (I) databases maintained by other international agencies; (2) own international surveys carried out in countries by independent entities and (3) modelled and estimated data, based on other data sources. More specifically, UNESCO analyses data inputs from a variety of sources to produce a consensus list of countries with freedom of information laws or equivalent. Among those organizations and experts that make available their data are: Freedominfo.org, Fringe Special by Robert Vleugels, Open Society Justice Initiative, Right to Information Rating, by Access Info Europe and the Centre for Law and Democracy, ARTICLE 19. Others include international agencies and UN bodies, such as: The World Bank, The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, The UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression.&lt;/p&gt;
