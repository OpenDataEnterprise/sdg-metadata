&lt;p&gt;Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors underlying it are essential for improving sexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or death during pregnancy and birth than their peers, and their children are also at greater risk of morbidity and death than children born to older women. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman&amp;#x2019;s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, having children at an early age curtails a woman&amp;#x2019;s opportunities for socio-economic improvement, particularly because young mothers are less likely to keep on studying and, if she needs to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence of young people&amp;#x2019;s access to health services since youth, in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services.&lt;/p&gt;
