These models use multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. The regional and global NEET rates are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that defines NEET rates - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to produce the NEET rate for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this direct aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing observations. For further information on the TEM, please refer to the technical background papers available at: <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm\">http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm</a>.</p>"}}
