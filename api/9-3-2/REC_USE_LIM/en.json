{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 9-3-2, translated into en","data":"## Comments and limitations\n\nThe main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by country indicating that data are obtained from different target populations. Data of one country are not comparable to another. \n\nThe definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal and policy framework of the country. It has implications on registration procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote “small-scale industries”. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size class for compilation purposes. In this context, UNIDO proposes that all countries compile the data by a size class of “small-scale industries” as with less than 20 persons employed. From such data, an internationally comparable data on the share of “small-scale industries” in total could be derived."}
