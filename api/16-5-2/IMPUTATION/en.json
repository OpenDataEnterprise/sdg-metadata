{"status":"success","message":"The IMPUTATION field for indicator 16-5-2, translated into en","data":"## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At country level**\n\n    The indicator value is not imputed for countries which do not have an Enterprise Survey.\n\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Regional and global aggregates of the indicator are derived from completed surveys. A single point estimate is created for each country and a global/regional aggregate takes a simple average of every countryâ€™s point estimate (when there is available data for that country). For example the East Asia Pacific average (point estimate) for the indicator does not include Japan since there is no Enterprise Survey for Japan."}
