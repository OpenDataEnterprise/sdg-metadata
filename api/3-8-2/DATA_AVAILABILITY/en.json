{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_AVAILABILITY field for indicator 3-8-2, translated into en","data":"# Data Availability\n\nThis indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this into account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable household survey datasets from 155 countries. Some of these surveys were excluded because they were either inaccessible, lacked key variables required for the estimation of the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income, they did not pass the quality assurance process or were not part of a consistent time series.  As of December 2017 a total of 553 datapoints from 132 countries or territories spanning the period 1984-2015 have been used to produce SDG indicator 3.8.2.\n\nData availability measured in terms of the number of countries that WHO and the World Bank have currently reviewed and retained for the estimation of the “proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income” is as follows for the most recent year:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\"></td>\n    <td colspan=\"6\">\n      Retained by WHO and the World Bank for the estimation of the \"proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income\"\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>SDG regional breakdown</td>\n    <td>Number of WHO Member States</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">2005 or earlier</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">2006-2015</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Total per SDG region</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\"></td>\n    <td>(nb of MS)</td>\n    <td>(% by region)</td>\n    <td>(nb of MS)</td>\n    <td>(% by region)</td>\n    <td>(nb of MS)</td>\n    <td>(% by region)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Northern America (M49) and Europe (M49)</td>\n    <td>44</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>13.60%</td>\n    <td>33</td>\n    <td><strong>75.00%</strong></td>\n    <td>39</td>\n    <td><strong>88.60%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Latin America and the Caribbean (MDG=M49)</td>\n    <td>33</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>21.20%</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n    <td>30.30%</td>\n    <td>17</td>\n    <td><strong>51.50%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Central Asia (M49) and Southern Asia (MDG=M49)</td>\n    <td>14</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0.00%</td>\n    <td>11</td>\n    <td><strong>78.60%</strong></td>\n    <td>11</td>\n    <td><strong>78.60%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Eastern Asia (M49) and South-eastern Asia (MDG=M49)</td>\n    <td>16</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>12.50%</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n    <td><strong>62.50%</strong></td>\n    <td>12</td>\n    <td><strong>75.00%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Western Asia (M49) and Northern Africa (M49)</td>\n    <td>23</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>17.40%</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n    <td>39.10%</td>\n    <td>13</td>\n    <td><strong>56.50%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sub-Saharan Africa (M49)</td>\n    <td>48</td>\n    <td>16</td>\n    <td>33.30%</td>\n    <td>21</td>\n    <td>43.80%</td>\n    <td>37</td>\n    <td><strong>77.10%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Australia and New Zealand (M49)</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0.00%</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td><strong>50.00%</strong></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td><strong>50.00%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Oceania (M49) excluding Australia and New Zealand (M49)</td>\n    <td>14</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>7.10%</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0.00%</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>7.10%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>194</td>\n    <td>36</td>\n    <td>18.60%</td>\n    <td>95</td>\n    <td>49.00%</td>\n    <td>131</td>\n    <td><strong>67.50%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nOverall data availability covers at least 50% of all WHO member States in all M49 regions except for those in Oceania (7.1%).
