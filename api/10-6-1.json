In some institutions these two components are identical.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe United Nations is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This indicator aims to measure the degree to which States enjoy equal representation in different international organizations.\n\n## Concepts\n\nThe indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.\n\nThere is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or areas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" regions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations M.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”, while an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. Voting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a structural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining as Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation method\n\nThe computation uses each institutions’ own published membership and voting rights data from their respective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights allocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of membership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total number of members.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nData is calculated and presented separately for each international organization.\n\n# Data sources\n\n## Description\n\nAnnual reports, as presented on the website of the institution in question, are used as sources of data.\n\nSources of information by institution:\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly:<br>\nwebsite of the General Assembly\n\nUnited Nations Security Council:<br>\nReport of the Security Council for the respective year\n\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Council:<br>\nReport of the Economic and Social Council for the respective year\n\nInternational Monetary Fund:<br>\nAnnual Report for the respective year\n\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development:<br>\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis and Financial Statements for the respective year\n\nInternational Finance Corporation:<br>\nAnnual Report (volume 2) for the respective year\n\nAfrican Development Bank:<br>\nAnnual Report for the respective year\n\nAsian Development Bank:<br>\nAnnual Report for the respective year\n\nInter-American Development Bank:<br>\nAnnual Report for the respective year\n\nWorld Trade Organisation:<br>\nWTO Annual Report 2015\n\nFinancial Stability Board:<br>\nCharters of the Financial Stability Board\n\nList:\n\nGeneral Assembly website;<br>\nReport of the Security Council;<br>\nReport of the Economic and Social Council,<br>\nReport of the International Monetary Fund;<br>\nIBRD's Management’s Discussion & Analysis and Financial Statements;<br>\nIFC Annual Report (volume 2);<br>\nAfDB Annual Report;<br>\nADB Annual Report;<br>\nIADB Annual Report;<br>\nWTO Annual Report;<br>\nCharters of the Financial Stability Board\n\n# Data availability\n\nAvailable for all countries.\n\n# Calendar\n\n## Data release\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly:<br>\ncontinuous\n\nUnited Nations Security Council:<br>\nannually in September\n\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Council:<br>\nannually in October\n\nInternational Monetary Fund:<br>\nannually in October\n\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development:<br>\nannually in September\n\nInternational Finance Corporation:<br>\nannually in September\n\nAfrican Development Bank:<br>\nannually in May\n\nAsian Development Bank:<br>\nannually in April\n\nInter-American Development Bank:<br>\nannually in April\n\nWorld Trade Organisation:<br>\nannually in May\n\nFinancial Stability Board:<br>\nannually in January\n\n(UNGA: continuous UNSC: September 2016 ECOSOC: October 2016 IMF: October 2016 IBRD: September 2016 IFC: September 2016 AfDB: May 2017 ADB: April 2017 IADB: April 2017 WTO: May 2017 FSB: January 2017)\n\n# Data providers\n\n## Name\n\nUNGA, UNSC, ECOSOC, IMF, IBRD, IFC, AfDB, ADB, IADB, WTO, FSB\n\n## Description\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.\n\n# Data compilers\n\n## Name\n\nFFD/UN-DESA\n\n## Description\n\nThe data is compiled and the proportions calculated by the Financing for Development Office, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\n# References\n\n## URL\n\n<https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/>\n\n","ru":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
