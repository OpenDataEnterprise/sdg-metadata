&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates are computed by using national population sizes to compute a weighted average of country-specific values for the index. This is justified on the grounds that UHC is a property of countries, and the index of essential services is a summary measure of access to essential services for each country&amp;#x2019;s population.&lt;/p&gt;
