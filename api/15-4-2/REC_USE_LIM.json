Its user friendliness and smooth learning curve make it a perfect tool for performing fast, accurate and cost-effective assessments. It is free, open source and highly customizable for the specific data collection needs and methodologies. It builds upon very high resolution multi-temporal images from Google Earth and Bing Maps and Landsat 7 and 8 datasets from Google Earth Engine. Data and images are stored and globally available for any year from 2000, making possible the monitoring of the change over time. </p>\n<p>The indicator has a global accuracy of 99%, but at national level for small countries the degree of accuracy is lower. This will be improved over time as more countries expand the data collection within their territory. </p>\n<p>Data on mountain coverage are provided by the 2015 FAO/MPS global map of mountains.</p>"}}
