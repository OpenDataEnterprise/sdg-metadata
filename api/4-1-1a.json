Until August 2018, there was no globally agreed definition on minimum proficiency level. As an interim reporting strategy, the UIS has been reporting according to the minimum proficiency level defined by each assessment.\n\nMinimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment\nThe table below shows the minimum proficiency levels for each learning assessment by target grade/age and domain. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels will be mapped to the globally-defined minimum performance levels and policy descriptors, agreed upon in September 2018 (see 4.1.1. UIS request for reclassification 2018.09.28.docx) that will allow pedagogical linking. Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of children who achieved at least minimum proficiency levels.\n\nTable 1.

Learning outcomes from cross-national learning assessment are automatically comparable for countries which participated in the same cross-national learning assessments, but they are not comparable across different cross-national learning assessments without further analytical effort.  \n\nComparability over time is possible if the assessment is designed with an adequate linking process between waves of administration.  This is described in the note “4.1.1. UIS request for reclassification 20181001.docx.”\n\nMethodology\n\nComputation method\nThe number of children and/or young people at the relevant stage of education n in year t achieving at least the pre-defined proficiency level in subject s expressed as a percentage of the number of children and/or young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.\n\nMPL t,n,s,  = MP t,n,s / P t,n\nwhere: \nMP t,n,s    = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, who have achieved at least the minimum proficiency level in subject s. \nP t,n = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.\nn = the stage of education that was assessed\ns = the subject that was assessed (reading or mathematics).\n\nDisaggregation\nIndicator 4.1.1.a must be disaggregated by domain (reading and mathematics) and sex.\n\nTreatment of missing values\n* At the country level: Missing values are not imputed.\n* At the regional and global levels: Missing values are not imputed.\n\nRegional aggregates\nNot yet applicable.

Typically, Cross National Large Scale Assessment, either regional or international, define various performance levels, and report as well the mean and standard deviation. They choose as well one level as the cut-off point that defines what children/youth are below or above level.\n* National Large-Scale Assessments either sample- or census- based. Countries should report the proportion of students by level of competency for each domain indicating as well the minimum proficiency level, when it is defined by the national assessment.
