	<data>## Treatment of missing values

* **At country level**

    Missing values in consumption of particular items are counted as zero. This is a standard practice in processing survey data. If the consumption is not reported, it is taken as zero consumption, and thus the consumption expenditure is zero.

* **At regional and global levels**

    Because national poverty lines are country-specific. There is no aggregation at the regional or global level.</data>
