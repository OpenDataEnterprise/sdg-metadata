The employment data derived from the Trends Econometric Models (TEM) are used to produce estimates on labour productivity. These models use multivariate regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. For further information on the TEM, please refer to the technical background papers available at: <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm\">http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm</a>.</p>"}}
