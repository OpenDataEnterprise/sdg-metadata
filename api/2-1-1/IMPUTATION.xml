* At country level 

When no data on food consumption is available from a recent household survey, the model-based estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of DEC from Food Balance Sheets, an indirect estimate of CV based on information on the country’s GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price of food, or other indicators of development such as country’s Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the MDER based on the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects data. 

See the section on method of computation for details. 

* At regional and global levels 

Missing values for individual countries are implicitly imputed to be equal to the population weighted average of the estimated values of the countries present in the same region.
