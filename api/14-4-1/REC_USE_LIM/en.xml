	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 14-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources very well, and is an end-result measure of Target 14.2. However, its derivation is not only data hungry, but also technically demanding as it needs stock assessment. This is also the reason why there is no data at country level.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
