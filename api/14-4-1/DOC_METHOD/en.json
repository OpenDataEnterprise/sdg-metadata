Each stock was estimated using the method described in FAO Technical Paper 569<sup> </sup>(<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf</a>). If the stock has abundance below the level that can produce maximum sustainable yield, it was counted as overfished. The indicator measures the % of the assessed stocks are within biologically sustainable levels. </p>\n<p>However, no such assessments have been done at country level and no methods and guidance of assessment at country level have been established because stock assessment requires numerical modelling skills and is highly data demanding so that the majority of developing countries do not have the capacity of carrying out its own stock assessment.</p>"}
