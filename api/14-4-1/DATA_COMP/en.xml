&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fishery sustainability is defined based on stock abundance. To know stock abundance, one needs to carry out stock assessment that uses fish catch statistics, fishing effort data and biological information and fit the data to a population dynamics model. After completing stock assessment for all stocks concerned, fish stocks that have abundance at or above the level associated with the maximum sustainable yield are counted as biologically sustainable, and otherwise are considered as overfished.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
