&lt;p&gt;The concept of&amp;#xA0;&amp;#x201C;within biologically sustainable levels&amp;#x201D; means that abundance of the fish stock is at or higher than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We estimated 584 fish stocks around world since 1974, representing 70% of global landings. Each stock was estimated using the method described in FAO Technical Paper 569&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). If the stock has abundance below the level that can produce maximum sustainable yield, it was counted as overfished. The indicator measures the % of the assessed stocks are within biologically sustainable levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no such assessments have been done at country level and no methods and guidance of assessment at country level have been established because stock assessment requires numerical modelling skills and is highly data demanding so that the majority of developing countries do not have the capacity of carrying out its own stock assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
