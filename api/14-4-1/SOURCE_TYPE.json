For example, catch data are often reported to FAO by member countries, but fishing effort data and other biological data may come from other sources. A great effort must be made to collect data that are needed for stock assessment. Also, it is worth noting that this indicator cannot be directly calculated from the data, but only through stock assessment which is a mathematical modelling process.</p>"}}
