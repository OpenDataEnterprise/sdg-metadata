&lt;p&gt;The indicator measure the sustainability of fish resources based on two major considerations: yield and reproduction. When a stock is fished biologically sustainable, it produces good yield without impairing the stock&amp;apos;s reproductivity, reaching a good balance between human use and ecological conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion is just calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by its production volume or stock abundance, that is every fish stock is considered of the same importance.&lt;/p&gt;
