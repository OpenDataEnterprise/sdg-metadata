{"status":"success","message":"The IMPUTATION field for indicator 8-4-2, translated into all languages","data":{"en":"## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At a country level**\n\n    A zero is imputed when no positive real value was officially recorded, in the base data sets used, for any of the underlying components which make up this aggregated total. Thus “0.0” can represent either NA, or a genuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common situation. This allows for values to be easily aggregated into further aggregations; however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing missing values as ‘0.0’, the aggregations may represent a lower value than actual situation.\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Similarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global aggregations. However, in the case where no data is available at all for a particular country then the per capita and per GDP estimates are weighted averages of the available data.","ru":""}}
