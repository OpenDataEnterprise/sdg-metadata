The first component is that transaction costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This transaction cost should be intended as **“Global average total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount sent”**. This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.","ru":""}}
