National poverty rate is defined at country-specific poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across countries and different from the $1.90-a-day international poverty line. Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with the $1.90-a-day poverty rate.","CLASS_SYSTEM":"## Concepts\n\nIn assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about “global poverty?” Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. But to consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need to treat two people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same way—both are either poor or not poor—even if they live in different countries.\n\nSince World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when the World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Early editions of the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2011 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank’s International Comparison Program (ICP).","COLL_METHOD":"## Collection process\n\nThe World Bank transparently shares and makes public the methodologies for all kinds of adjustments to original data (e.g., through its PovcalNet website and its various analytical documents).

The original “$1-a-day” line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a new compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day. This is the average poverty line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set.\n\nThe current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries.\n\nWhen measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $’s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years.","DATA_SOURCE":"# Data providers\n\nThe World Bank typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. Please see the section on data sources for further details.","DISAGGREGATION":"## Disaggregation\n\nWork is underway at the World Bank for disaggregated poverty estimates.","FREQ_COLL":"# Calendar\n\n## Data collection\n\nSource collection is ongoing by the Global Poverty Working Group of the World Bank. The calculation of new poverty numbers using updated source data normally takes place from May to September every year.","IMPUTATION":"## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At country level**\n\n    There is no “imputation” in the traditional sense for missing country data. However, to generate regional and global aggregates for reference years, country-level data are imputed for the years when surveys are not conducted. These imputed data are to be used for aggregation, but not for replacing the actual survey data. The subsequent section on the treatment of missing values at the regional and global levels provide more details on the imputation method.\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    To compare the poverty rates across countries and compute regional aggregates, country estimates must be “lined up” first to a common reference year, interpolating for countries in which survey data are not available in the reference year but are available either before, after, or both. The more survey data are available (that is, the more data for different years), the more accurate the interpolation.\n\n    The process requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the reference year. Thus, two assumptions are required to implement this process: distribution-neutral growth and a real rate of growth between the survey and reference year.\n\n    Distribution-neutral growth implies that income or expenditure levels are adjusted for growth assuming that the underlying relative distribution of income or expenditure observed in survey years remains unchanged. Under this assumption, it is straightforward to interpolate the poverty estimate in a given reference year implied by a given rate of growth in income or expenditure. Rates of change in real consumption per capita should be based on the change in real consumption measured by comparing country survey data across different years. In practice, however, survey data in most countries are not available on an annual basis. Therefore, the change in private consumption per capita as measured from the national accounts is used instead. While, there can be no guarantee that the survey-based measure of income or consumption change at exactly the same rate as private consumption in the national accounts, this appears to be the best available option.\n\n    When the reference year falls between two survey years, an estimate of mean consumption at the reference year is constructed by extrapolating the means obtained from the surveys forward and backward to the reference year. The second step is to compute the headcount poverty rate at the reference year after normalizing the distributions observed in the two survey years by the reference year mean. This yields two estimates of the headcount poverty rates in the reference year. The final reported poverty headcount rate for the reference years is the linear interpolation of the two. When data from only one survey year are available, the reference year mean is based on the survey mean by applying the growth rate in private consumption per capita from the national accounts. The reference year poverty estimate is then based on this mean and on the distribution observed in the one survey year. The better data coverage is in terms of number and frequency of available surveys, the more accurate this lining-up process is and the more reliable the regional estimates will be.\n\n    The aggregate headcount ratio for a region is the population-weighted mean of the headcount indices across the countries in that region. The number of poor in each region is the product of the region’s headcount index and total regional population. This assumes that the poverty rate for a country without a household survey is the regional average.","LANGUAGE":"ENG","META_LAST_UPDATE":"7/19/2016","META_PAGE":"1.1.1A","RATIONALE":"## Rationale\n\nMonitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries.

The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys needs to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income countries. The low frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction.\n\nBesides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries.\n\nHowever, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure but may not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary.","REFERENCES":"## References\n\nFor more information and methodology, please see PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm).

This is the average poverty line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set.\n\nThe current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries.\n\nWhen measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $’s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nWork is underway at the World Bank for disaggregated poverty estimates.\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At country level**\n\n    There is no “imputation” in the traditional sense for missing country data. However, to generate regional and global aggregates for reference years, country-level data are imputed for the years when surveys are not conducted. These imputed data are to be used for aggregation, but not for replacing the actual survey data. The subsequent section on the treatment of missing values at the regional and global levels provide more details on the imputation method.\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    To compare the poverty rates across countries and compute regional aggregates, country estimates must be “lined up” first to a common reference year, interpolating for countries in which survey data are not available in the reference year but are available either before, after, or both. The more survey data are available (that is, the more data for different years), the more accurate the interpolation.\n\n    The process requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the reference year. Thus, two assumptions are required to implement this process: distribution-neutral growth and a real rate of growth between the survey and reference year.\n\n    Distribution-neutral growth implies that income or expenditure levels are adjusted for growth assuming that the underlying relative distribution of income or expenditure observed in survey years remains unchanged. Under this assumption, it is straightforward to interpolate the poverty estimate in a given reference year implied by a given rate of growth in income or expenditure. Rates of change in real consumption per capita should be based on the change in real consumption measured by comparing country survey data across different years. In practice, however, survey data in most countries are not available on an annual basis. Therefore, the change in private consumption per capita as measured from the national accounts is used instead. While, there can be no guarantee that the survey-based measure of income or consumption change at exactly the same rate as private consumption in the national accounts, this appears to be the best available option.\n\n    When the reference year falls between two survey years, an estimate of mean consumption at the reference year is constructed by extrapolating the means obtained from the surveys forward and backward to the reference year. The second step is to compute the headcount poverty rate at the reference year after normalizing the distributions observed in the two survey years by the reference year mean.

These estimates for line-up years are then aggregated to regional and global numbers. Regional and global aggregates are population-weighted averages.\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nNational poverty is a different concept than global poverty. National poverty rate is defined at country-specific poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across countries and different from the $1.90-a-day international poverty line. Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with the $1.90-a-day poverty rate.\n\n# Data sources\n\n## Description\n\nThe World Bank typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly.

In some case, the national poverty line is adjusted for different areas (such as urban and rural) within the country, to account for differences in prices or the availability of goods and services.

National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country’s specific economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.","REC_USE_LIM":"## Comments and limitations\n\nNational poverty estimates are derived from household survey data. Caveats and limitations inherent to survey data applying to the construction of indicator 1.1.1 apply here as well.\n\nTo be useful for poverty estimates, surveys must be nationally representative. They must also include enough information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household consumption or income (including consumption or income from own production) and to construct a correctly weighted distribution of consumption or income per person.\n\nConsumption is the preferred welfare indicator for a number of reasons. [^1] Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately. For example, the poor who work in the informal sector may not receive or report monetary wages; self-employed workers often experience irregular income flows; and many people in rural areas depend on idiosyncratic, agricultural incomes. Moreover, consumption accords better with the idea of the standard of living than income, which can vary over time even if the actual standard of living does not. Thus, whenever possible, consumption-based welfare indicators are used to estimate the poverty measures reported here. But consumption data are not always available. For instance in Latin America and the Caribbean, the vast majority of countries collect primarily income data. In those cases there is little choice but to use income data.\n\nConsumption is measured by using household survey questions on food and nonfood expenditures as well as food consumed from the household’s own production, which is particularly important in the poorest developing countries. This information is collected either through recall questions using lists of consumption items or through diaries in which respondents record all expenditures daily. But these methods do not always provide equivalent information, and depending on the approach used, consumption can be underestimated or overestimated. Different surveys use different recall or reference periods. Depending on the true flow of expenditures, the rate of spending reported is sensitive to the length of reporting period. The longer the reference period, the more likely respondents will fail to recall certain expenses—especially food items—thus resulting in underestimation of true expenditure.\n\nBest-practice surveys administer detailed lists of specific consumption items. These individual items collected through the questionnaires are aggregated afterwards. But many surveys use questionnaires in which respondents are asked to report expenditures for broad categories of goods. In other words, specific consumption items are implicitly aggregated by virtue of the questionnaire design. This shortens the interview, reducing the cost of the survey. A shorter questionnaire is also thought to reduce the likelihood of fatigue for both respondents and interviewers, which can lead to reporting errors. However, there is also evidence that less detailed coverage of specific items in the questionnaire can lead to underestimation of actual household consumption. The reuse of questionnaires may cause new consumption goods to be omitted, leading to further underreporting.\n\nInvariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home. This is often referred to as “unit nonresponse” and is distinct from “item nonresponse,” which occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but refuse to answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to consumption or income. To the extent that survey nonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will still be representative of the population. However, households with different incomes are not equally likely to respond. Relatively rich households may be less likely to participate because of the high opportunity cost of their time or because of concerns about intrusion in their affairs. It is conceivable that the poorest can likewise be underrepresented; some are homeless and hard to reach in standard household survey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus less easily interviewed. If nonresponse systematically increases with income, surveys will tend to overestimate poverty. But if compliance tends to be lower for both the very poor and the very rich, there will be potentially offsetting effects on the measured incidence of poverty.\n\nEven if survey data were entirely accurate and comprehensive, the measure of poverty obtained could still fail to capture important aspects of individual welfare. For example, using household consumption measures ignores potential inequalities within households. Thus, consumption- or income-based poverty measures are informative but should not be interpreted as a sufficient statistic for assessing the quality of people’s lives. The national poverty rate, a “headcount” measure, is one of the most commonly calculated measures of poverty. Yet it has the drawback that it does not capture income inequality among the poor or the depth of poverty. For instance, it fails to account for the fact that some people may be living just below the poverty line, while others experience far greater shortfalls. Policymakers seeking to make the largest possible impact on the headcount measure might be tempted to direct their poverty alleviation resources to those closest to the poverty line (and therefore least poor).\n\nIssues may also arise when comparing poverty measures within countries when urban and rural poverty lines represent different purchasing powers. For example, the cost of living is typically higher in urban than in rural areas. One reason is that food staples tend to be more expensive in urban areas. So the urban monetary poverty line should be higher than the rural poverty line. But it is not always clear that the difference between urban and rural poverty lines found in practice reflects only differences in the cost of living. In some countries the urban poverty line in common use has a higher real value—meaning that it allows the purchase of more commodities for consumption—than does the rural poverty line. Sometimes the difference has been so large as to imply that the incidence of poverty is greater in urban than in rural areas, even though the reverse is found when adjustments are made only for differences in the cost of living. As with international comparisons, when the real value of the poverty line varies it is not clear how meaningful such urban-rural comparisons are.\n\nLastly, these income/consumption based poverty indicators do not fully reflect the other dimensions of poverty such as inequality, vulnerability, and lack of voice and power of the poor.","REG_AGG":"## Regional aggregates\n\nN/A","REL_CAL_POLICY":"## Data release\n\nEnd of March 2017.","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"# Institutional information\n\n## Organization(s)\nWorld Bank","SDG_GOAL":"Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere","SDG_INDICATOR":"Indicator 1.2.1: Proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"# Related indicators\n\nIndicator 1.1.1: Proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural)","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"## Time series\n\nData are available from 1985 to 2015.

The reuse of questionnaires may cause new consumption goods to be omitted, leading to further underreporting.\n\nInvariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home. This is often referred to as “unit nonresponse” and is distinct from “item nonresponse,” which occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but refuse to answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to consumption or income. To the extent that survey nonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will still be representative of the population. However, households with different incomes are not equally likely to respond. Relatively rich households may be less likely to participate because of the high opportunity cost of their time or because of concerns about intrusion in their affairs. It is conceivable that the poorest can likewise be underrepresented; some are homeless and hard to reach in standard household survey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus less easily interviewed. If nonresponse systematically increases with income, surveys will tend to overestimate poverty. But if compliance tends to be lower for both the very poor and the very rich, there will be potentially offsetting effects on the measured incidence of poverty.\n\nEven if survey data were entirely accurate and comprehensive, the measure of poverty obtained could still fail to capture important aspects of individual welfare. For example, using household consumption measures ignores potential inequalities within households. Thus, consumption- or income-based poverty measures are informative but should not be interpreted as a sufficient statistic for assessing the quality of people’s lives. The national poverty rate, a “headcount” measure, is one of the most commonly calculated measures of poverty. Yet it has the drawback that it does not capture income inequality among the poor or the depth of poverty. For instance, it fails to account for the fact that some people may be living just below the poverty line, while others experience far greater shortfalls. Policymakers seeking to make the largest possible impact on the headcount measure might be tempted to direct their poverty alleviation resources to those closest to the poverty line (and therefore least poor).\n\nIssues may also arise when comparing poverty measures within countries when urban and rural poverty lines represent different purchasing powers. For example, the cost of living is typically higher in urban than in rural areas. One reason is that food staples tend to be more expensive in urban areas. So the urban monetary poverty line should be higher than the rural poverty line. But it is not always clear that the difference between urban and rural poverty lines found in practice reflects only differences in the cost of living. In some countries the urban poverty line in common use has a higher real value—meaning that it allows the purchase of more commodities for consumption—than does the rural poverty line. Sometimes the difference has been so large as to imply that the incidence of poverty is greater in urban than in rural areas, even though the reverse is found when adjustments are made only for differences in the cost of living. As with international comparisons, when the real value of the poverty line varies it is not clear how meaningful such urban-rural comparisons are.\n\nLastly, these income/consumption based poverty indicators do not fully reflect the other dimensions of poverty such as inequality, vulnerability, and lack of voice and power of the poor.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nThe formula for calculating the proportion of the total, urban and rural population living below the national poverty line, or headcount index, is as follows:\n\n<math>\n  <munder>\n    <mrow>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mn>0</mn>\n      </msub>\n      <mo>=</mo>\n      <mfrac>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n        <mi>N</mi>\n      </mfrac>\n      <munderover>\n        <mo>∑</mo>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>N</mi>\n      </munderover>\n      <mi>I</mi>\n      <mo>(</mo>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n      </msub>\n      <mo>&lt;</mo>\n      <mi>z</mi>\n      <mo>)</mo>\n      <mo>=</mo>\n      <mfrac>\n        <msub>\n          <mi>N</mi>\n          <mi>p</mi>\n        </msub>\n        <mi>N</mi>\n      </mfrac>\n    </mrow>\n    <mrow>\n      <mo>=</mo>\n      <mn>1</mn>\n    </mrow>\n  </munder>\n</math>\n\nWhere *I*(.) is an indicator function that takes on a value of 1 if the bracketed expression is true, and 0 otherwise. If individual consumption or income *y*<sub>i</sub> is less than the national poverty line *z* (for example, in absolute terms the line could be the price of a consumption bundle or in relative terms a percentage of the income distribution), then *I*(.) is equal to 1 and the individual is counted as poor. *N*<sub>p</sub> is the total, urban or rural number of poor. *N* is the total, urban or rural population.\n\nConsumption or income data are gathered from nationally representative household surveys, which contain detailed responses to questions regarding spending habits and sources of income. Consumption, including consumption from own production, or income is calculated for the entire household. In some cases, an “effective” household size is calculated from the actual household size to reflect assumed efficiencies in consumption; adjustments may also be made to reflect the number of children in a household. The number of people in those households is aggregated to estimate the number of poor persons.\n\nNational poverty rates use a country specific poverty line, reflecting the country’s economic and social circumstances. In some case, the national poverty line is adjusted for different areas (such as urban and rural) within the country, to account for differences in prices or the availability of goods and services. Typically the urban poverty line is set higher than the rural poverty line; reflecting the relatively higher costs of living in urban areas.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nThe only aggregation is by rural and urban areas.\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At country level**\n\n    Missing values in consumption of particular items are counted as zero. This is a standard practice in processing survey data. If the consumption is not reported, it is taken as zero consumption, and thus the consumption expenditure is zero.\n\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Because national poverty lines are country-specific. There is no aggregation at the regional or global level.\n\n## Regional aggregates\n\nN/A\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nNational poverty estimates is a different concept from international poverty estimates. National poverty rate is defined at country-specific poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across countries and different from the $1.90-a-day international poverty line. Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with the $1.90-a-day poverty rate.\n\n# Data Sources\n\n## Description\n\nNational poverty estimates are typically produced and owned by country governments (e.g., National Statistic Office), and sometimes with technical assistance from the World Bank and UNDP. Upon release of the national poverty estimates by the government, the Global Poverty Working Group of the World Bank assesses the methodology used by the government, validates the estimates with raw data whenever possible, and consults the country economists for publishing. Accepted estimates, along with metadata, will be published in the WDI database as well as the Poverty and Equity Database of the World Bank. \n\nAnother source is World Bank’s Poverty Assessments. The World Bank periodically prepares poverty assessments of countries in which it has an active program, in close collaboration with national institutions, other development agencies, and civil society groups, including poor people’s organizations. Poverty assessments report the extent and causes of poverty and propose strategies to reduce it. The poverty assessments are the best available source of information on poverty estimates using national poverty lines. They often include separate assessments of urban and rural poverty.\n\n## Collection process:\n\nSource collection is ongoing by the Global Poverty Working Group of the World Bank. The data in World Development Indicators (WDI) are updated quarterly following the WDI database [^2] updating schedule.\n\n# Data Availability\n\n## Description\n\nData availability depends on the availability of household surveys and analysis of survey data. Data for total, rural and urban poverty are currently available for 132, 101 and 103 countries, respectively.\n\n## Time series\n\nData are available from 1985 to 2015. Because the effort and capacity of collecting and analysing survey data are different for each country, the length of the time series for each country varies greatly.\n\n# Calendar\n\n## Data collection\n\nThe schedule of source collection is determined by the country governments.

Also known as the “5x5 objective”, this goal was adopted by the G8 in 2009, and it refers to reduction of the global average total cost of migrant remittances by 5 percentage points in 5 years. To achieve this objective, the governments in both sending and receiving countries should consider implementing reforms based upon the General Principles for International Remittances Services by the World Bank/Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (January 2007). This internationally agreed framework has proven effective in helping reduce the cost of remittances and guiding actions to enhance the efficiency of international remittances. The World Bank’s RPW database is the only global database that monitors remittance prices across all regions of the world. RPW was launched by the World Bank in September 2008, and is a key tool in monitoring the evolution of costs to the remitters and the beneficiaries from sending and receiving money in major country corridors.\n\n## Concepts\n\n**International remittance transfer.** A cross-border person-to-person payment of relatively low value. The transfers are typically recurrent payments by migrant workers (who send money to their families in their home country every month). In the report, the term “remittance transfer” is used for simplicity (ie it is assumed the transfer is international).\n\n**Remittance service.** A service that enables end users to send and/or receive remittance transfers.\n\n**Remittance service provider (RSP).** An entity, operating as a business, that provides a remittance service for a price to end users, either directly or through agents. These include both banks and money transfer operators, as defined below.\n\n**Money transfer operator (MTO).** A non-deposit taking payment service provider where the service involves payment per transfer (or possibly payment for a set or series of transfers) by the sender to the payment service provider (for example, by cash or bank transfer) – i.e. as opposed to a situation where the payment service provider debits an account held by the sender at the payment service provider. MTOs may include both traditional players focusing on delivering funds in cash and innovative players which may adopt a variety of different business models for the delivery of the transactions.\n\n**Price.** The total cost to the end users of sending a remittance transfer (including the fees charged to the sender and the margin by which the exchange rate charged to the end users is above the current interbank exchange rate).\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nNA\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nData is collected through a mystery shopping exercise of remittance service providers (RSPs). A sample of RSPs including at least 80% of the market share in each corridor are included in the mystery shopping exercise. The average cost is calculated as the simple average of total costs (including both fee and exchange rate margin) quoted by each RSP operating in a corridor.\n\nIn 2016, introduced the Smart Remitter Target (SmarRT) to monitor remittance transactions at a more granular level. It aims to reflect the cost that a savvy consumer with access to sufficiently complete information would pay to transfer remittances in each corridor. SmaRT is calculated as the simple average as the three cheapest services for sending the equivalent of $200 in each corridor and is expressed in terms of the percentage of the total amount sent. In addition to transparency, services must meet additional criteria to be included in SmaRT, including transaction speed (5 days or less) and accessibility (determined by geographic proximity of branches for services that require physical presence, or access to any technology or device necessary to use the service, such as a bank account, mobile phone or the internet. \n\nFor additional information on the methodology of SmaRT, please see: **https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/smart_methodology.pdf **\n\nTarget 10.c.1 includes two components, which require two separate calculations:\n1. Global average of remittance costs to be reduced to less than 3 percent: this is calculated as the simple average of the total cost for all services included in the RPW database\n2. Enabling remittance senders in all corridors to send money to their receivers at a cost of 5 percent or less: this is calculated as the average cost of the three cheapest available services in each corridor which meet a defined set of minimum requirements, as described in the World Bank SmaRT methodology. The target is that the SmaRT average for all corridors should be 5 percent or lower.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nRPW tracks the cost of remittances by the type of remittance service providers: commercial banks, money transfer operators, post offices, mobile money providers (more provider types may be added as market evolves). In addition, disaggregation is also possible by the instrument used to fund the transaction: including but not limited to cash, bank account, debit/credit card, mobile money etc.; and by the instrument used to disburse the funds: including but not limited to cash, bank account, mobile wallet etc.\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At country level**\n\n    A sample of corridors is collected for each sending and receiving country. It is assumed that the cost of other corridors from/to each country fall in similar cost range.\n\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Regional aggregates are computed by calculating simple averages of individual services remitting to the recipient countries in the region for which there is data. Countries with no data are not included, however, as a representative sample is built, it is assumed that missing data fall in the same cost range as collected data.\n\n## Regional aggregates\n\nRegional aggregates are computed by calculating simple averages of individual services remitting to the recipient countries in the region for which there is data.\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nThere are no country-produced alternatives for this data, except for countries that have established a remittance price database in line with World Bank minimum requirements. It has been observed that data are broadly in line and no significant discrepancies exist.\n\n## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level\n\n* Minimum requirements for national and regional databases are provided on the Remittance Prices Worldwide website at: <https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en/national-and-regional-databases-certified-by-the-world-bank.> For consistent methodology, the following minimum requirements were established:\n    1.

The World Bank uses vendor services for data collection and compilation. The data is then reviewed in detail by the World Bank RPW team, who also undertakes the analysis.\n\n# Data Sources\n\nData sources are the remittance service providers (RSPs) themselves.

The three criteria of informal settlements are essentially captured in the definition of slums, which sustains the combination of both (slums/informal settlements). From the seven criteria of adequate housing, the three that are not covered by slums / informal settlements are affordability, accessibility and cultural adequacy. For the purpose of composing an indicator, affordability is the most relevant and easier to measure.\n\nThus, in order to come up with a composite indicator, the metadata for the SDG Indicator 11.1.1 is proposing to group the definition of slums and informal settlements, to allow for comparison with MDGs, and add the element of affordability from the definition of adequate housing.\n\nIn this regard, housing affordability is not only a key housing adequacy criterion, but is a suitable means of measuring inadequate housing in a more encompassing manner, as it remains a global challenge across different countries and income levels, with strong negative impact on urban inequality.\nThe underlying principle is that household financial costs associated with housing should not threaten or compromise the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs such as, food, education, access to health care, transport, etc. Based on the existing method and data of UN-Habitat’s Urban Indicators Program (1996-2006), unaffordability is currently measured as the net monthly expenditure on housing cost that exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household.\n\nThus, Indicator 11.1.1 is expected to be a **composite one**, with the main components of slum/informal settlements’ and the added component of affordability defining inadequate housing. Table 1 details the proposed definition of Slum/Informal Settlements and Inadequate Housing as well as the respective measurements.\n\n### Table 1 – Definition and measurement criteria for slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing\n\n# Slums / Informal Settlements\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nAs adopted in the MDG, household where the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following ‘household deprivations’: 1) Lack of access to improved water source, 2) Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, 3) Lack of sufficient living area, 4) Lack of housing durability and, 5) Lack of security of tenure).\n\n## MEASUREMENT [^12]:\n\n### Security of Tenure\n\n* Proportion of households with formal title deeds to both land and residence.\n* Proportion of households with formal title deeds to either one of land or residence.\n* Proportion of households with agreements or any document as a proof of a tenure arrangement.\n\n### Adequate water\n\nA settlement has an inadequate drinking water supply if less than 50% of households have an improved water supply:\n\n* household connection;\n* access to public stand pipe;\n* rainwater collection; with at least 20 liters/person/day available within an acceptable collection distance.\n\n### Access to sanitation\n\nA settlement has inadequate sanitation if less than 50% of households have improved sanitation:\n\n* public sewer;\n* septic tank;\n* pour-flush latrine;\n* Ventilated improved pit latrine.\n\nThe excreta disposal system is considered adequate if it is private or shared by a maximum of two households.\n\n### Structural quality of Housing and location\n\nProportion of households residing on or near a hazardous site. The following locations should be considered:\n\n* housing in geologically hazardous zones (landslide/earthquake and flood areas);\n* housing on or under garbage mountains;\n* housing around high-industrial pollution areas;\n* housing around other unprotected high-risk zones (e.g. railroads, airports, energy transmission lines).\n\n### Structural quality of the housing and permanency of the structure\n\nProportion of households living in temporary and/or dilapidated structures. The following factors should be considered when placing a housing unit in these categories:\n\n* quality of construction (e.g. materials used for wall, floor and roof);\n* compliance with local building codes, standards and bylaws.\n\n### Sufficient living area / Overcrowding\n\n* Proportion of households with more than two persons per room.\n\n# Inadequate housing\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nProposed to complement the slums/informal settlements measuring affordability of housing at the global level.\n\n## MEASUREMENT\n\n### Affordability\n\n* Proportion of households with net monthly expenditure on housing exceeding 30% of the total monthly income of the household.","REC_USE_LIM":"## Comments and limitations\n\nAs with all indicators, there are a number of potential challenges and limitations. Some of these are outlined below.\n\n* Difficulties to agree universally on some definitions and characteristics when referring to deteriorated housing conditions, often due to political or economic considerations.\n* Lack of appropriate tools at national and city levels to measure all components required by Indicator 11.1.1, sometimes resulting in the underestimation of deteriorated housing units.\n* The complicated relation between security of tenure with land and property makes it a difficult, but vital, aspect to include in the different surveys, and thus, to measure and monitor.\n* Indicator 11.1.1 does not capture homelessness.\n* Many countries still have limited capacities for data collection, management and analysis, their update and monitoring. These are key to ensure national and global data consistency.","REFERENCES":"References\n\nBibliographic References\n* United Nations (2007).

People living in adequate homes have better health, higher chances to improve their human capital and seize the opportunities available in urban contexts. At the same time, a housing sector that performs well acts as a ‘development multiplier’ benefiting complementary industries, contributing to economic development, employment generation, service provision and overall poverty reduction. Broadly, for every job in the house-building sector, an additional 1.5 to 2 jobs are generally created in the construction materials and other input industries. The contributions of housing to urban prosperity are also evident. The UN-Habitat City Prosperity Initiative reveals indicates that inadequate housing has negative effects on several other dimensions of urban prosperity. Urban contexts with housing conditions below average experience poorer equity and inclusion, reduced urban safety and livelihood opportunities, and have neglected connectivity and provision of public space.\n\nInadequate housing thus remains very much a global urban sustainability challenge but also development opportunity. At the same time, the thematic area of ‘adequate housing’ and especially the term ‘slums’ - are often highly politicized. More nuanced definitions of these terms would enable and support a more robust and measured debate, greater engagement by all key stakeholders and the development of specific recommendations for application within each context and place.\n\nIn order to develop a more nuanced definition, there are a number of interrelated terms that must be grappled with when considering an indicator for the SDG Target 11.1. They include inadequate housing and housing affordability, informal settlements and slums.\n\n## Housing affordability\n\nOne of the most daunting challenges of urbanization globally has been the provision of adequate housing that people can afford. Findings from the UN Global Sample of Cities {^1} show that people across all types of urban centres are not able to afford home ownership or even the cost of rental housing. In low-income countries for example, households need to save the equivalent of nearly eight times their annual household income in order to be able to afford the price of a standard house in their town or city. If they rent, households have to commit more than 25 per cent of their monthly income to rent payments.  [^2]\n\nThe affordability issue is affecting the developing and developed worlds alike. In Latin America, high house price-to-income ratio and inaccessible housing finance compel households to resort to informal solutions without the benefits of planning and safety regulations. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, less than 10 per cent of households are able to afford a mortgage for even the cheapest newly built house. In fact, African households face 55 per cent higher housing costs relative to their per capita GDP than in other regions. [^3]  In many European countries, families, especially the youth, are severely cost burdened and have much less to spend on other necessities such as food, health, transport and clothing. In extreme circumstances, households are forced to leave their accommodation because of the inability to pay. The current migration crisis has worsened housing conditions in the region, a trend that seems set to continue in the next few years.\n\n## Inadequate housing, informal settlements and slums\n\nToday, an estimated 1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing globally, of which 1 billion live in slums and informal settlements. [^4] This means that about one in four people in cities live in conditions that harm their health, safety, prosperity and opportunities. Lack of access to basic services is a common constraint in informal settlements and slums: worldwide 2.4 billion people live without improved sanitation and 2 billion are affected by water stress. In spite of a decrease from 39 to 30 per cent of urban population living in slums between 2000 and 2014, absolute numbers continue to grow: currently, one quarter of the world’s urban population is estimated to live in slums, 881 million urban residents as opposed to 792 million in 2000.  Young women- and children-headed households are often the most vulnerable to inadequate housing conditions. Homelessness is also a growing challenge and it is estimated that more than 100 million people worldwide are homeless.  [^5]\n\nSlums represent one of the most extreme forms of deprivation and exclusion and remain a critical factor for the persistence of poverty and exclusion in the world – indeed a challenge for sustainable and inclusive urbanization. Research shows that other forms of urban poverty in the form of informal settlements increasingly become a worldwide phenomenon found also in the developed world.\n\nAt the same time, not all people who live in inadequate housing live in slums but are nonetheless living in very substandard conditions in the urban contexts in which they are situated. The nature of these unsatisfactory living conditions must be captured and better represented in the global, country and city-level data to ensure a more robust picture of inadequate housing is documented. In light of this, the following definitions are proposed.\n\n## Definition and concept\n\nAs per the 2030 Agenda, to guide the development of the appropriate policies and programmes for ensuring access for all to adequate housing and the upgrading of slums, it is necessary to identify and quantify the proportion of the population that live in slums, informal settlements and those living in inadequate housing.\n\n## Slums\n\n**a. Slums** – An expert group meeting was convened in 2002 by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Statistics Division and the Cities Alliance to agree on an operational definition for slums to be used for measuring the indicator of MDG 7 Target 7.D. The agreed definition classified a ‘slum household’ as one in which the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following *‘household deprivations’*:\n\n1. Lack of access to improved water source,\n2. Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities,\n3. Lack of sufficient living area,\n4. Lack of housing durability and,\n5. Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term ‘slum dweller’ refers to a person living in a household that lacks any of the above attributes. [^6]\n\nThese five components –all derived from the adequate housing’s definition have been used ever since for reporting and tracking of the MDGs, as the primary or secondary data measured to determine the number of slum dwellers living in developing countries. They were also the basis to establish the successful achievement of MDG Target 7.D. For each component, the experts agreed with the following sub-definitions:  [^7]\n\n1. *Access to improved water* – A household is considered to have access to improved drinking water if it has sufficient amount of water (20 litres/person/day) for family use, at an affordable price (less than 10% of the total household income) and available to household members without being subject to extreme effort (less than one hour a day for the minimum sufficient quantity), especially to women and children. An improved drinking water source is a facility that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from faecal matters’ contamination. Improved drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/stand pipe serving no more than 5 households; protected spring; rainwater collection; bottled water (if secondary source is also improved); bore hole/tube well; and, protected dug well.\n2. *Access to improved sanitation* – A household is considered to have access to improved sanitation if an excreta disposal system, either in the form of a private toilet or a public toilet shared with a reasonable number of people, is available to household members. Such improved sanitation facilities, therefore, hygienically separates human waste from human contact. Improved facilities include: flush/pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform, which covers the pit entirely; and, composting toilets/latrines.\n3. *Sufficient living area* /overcrowding– A dwelling unit provides sufficient living area for the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room. [^8}  Additional indicators of overcrowding have been proposed: area-level indicators such as average in-house living area per person or the number of households per area. Additionally, housing-unit level indicators such as the number of persons per bed or the number of children under five per room may also be viable. However, the number of persons per room has been shown to correlate with adverse health risks and is more commonly collected through household survey. [^9] UN-Habitat believes that the definition as it stands does not reflect the practical experience of overcrowding and as noted below, is proposing an alternative.\n\n    ![OVERCROWDING Sufficient living area: a house is considered to provide sufficient living area for the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room that is a minimum of four square meters in area. Considering a maximum of 3 people per habitable room of a minimum of 4 sqm, not even 2 single beds fit in such a room, thus it is assumed that 3 people sleep on 1 bed. Moreover, other furniture is unlikely to fit, Required ventilation is also a concern. Instead, if a minimum room of 9 sqm is considered, as this is the most typical size of a slum room, the room’s living area becomes viable for 3 people.](images/STAT_CONC_DEF1.png)\n\n    ### Figure 1- Example of Overcrowding\n\n4. *Structural quality/durability of dwellings* – A house is considered as ‘durable’ if it is built on a non-hazardous location and has a permanent and adequate structure able to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions such as rain, heat, cold, and humidity. The following criteria are used to determine the structural quality/durability of dwellings: permanency of structure (permanent building material for the walls, roof and floor; compliance with building codes; the dwelling is not in a dilapidated state; the dwelling is not in need of major repair); and location of house (hazardous location; the dwelling is not located on or near toxic waste; the dwelling is not located in a flood plain; the dwelling is not located on a steep slope; the dwelling is not located in a dangerous right of way: rail, highway, airport, power lines).\n5. *Security of tenure* – Secure tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective protection by the State against forced evictions. Security of tenure is understood as a set of relationships with respect to housing and land, established through statutory or customary law or informal or hybrid arrangements, that enables one to live in one’s home with security, peace and dignity (A/HRC/25/54). Regardless of the type of tenure, all persons with security of tenure have a legal status against arbitrary unlawful eviction, harassment and other threats. People have secure tenure when: there is evidence of documentation that can be used as proof of secure tenure status; and, there is either de facto or perceived protection from forced evictions. Important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into the computation of the people living in slums.\n\n## Informal Settlements\n\n**b. Informal Settlements** – Informal settlements are usually seen as synonymous of slums, with a particular focus on the formal status of land, structure and services. They are defined by three main criteria, according to Habitat III Issue Paper #22 [^10], which are already covered in the definition of slums. These are:\n\n1. *Inhabitants have no security of tenure* vis-à-vis the land or dwellings they inhabit, with modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental housing,\n2. The *neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, formal basic services* and city infrastructure, and\n3. The *housing may not comply with current planning and building regulations*, is often situated in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas, and may lack a municipal permit.\n\nInformal settlements can be occupied by all income levels of urban residents, affluent and poor.\n\n## Inadequate Housing\n\n**c. Inadequate Housing** – Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes housing as one of the components of the right to adequate standards of living for all. [^11] The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ general comments No.4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing and No.7 (1997) on forced evictions have underlined that the right to adequate housing should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. For housing to be adequate, it must provide more than four walls and a roof, and at a minimum, meet the following criteria:\n\n1. *Legal security of tenure*, which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats;\n2. *Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure*, including safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage or refuse disposal;\n3. *Affordability*, as housing is not adequate if its cost threatens or compromises the occupants’ enjoyment of other human rights;\n4. *Habitability*, as housing is not adequate if it does not guarantee physical safety or provide adequate space, as well as protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind, other threats to health and structural hazards;\n5. *Accessibility*, as housing is not adequate if the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups are not taken into account (such as the poor, people facing discrimination; persons with disabilities, victims of natural disasters);\n6. *Location*, as housing is not adequate if it is cut off from employment opportunities, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, or if located in dangerous or polluted sites or in immediate proximity to pollution sources; and\n7. *Cultural adequacy*, as housing is not adequate if it does not respect and take into account the expression of cultural identity and ways of life.\n\n## Table 1.

People living in adequate homes have better health, higher chances to improve their human capital and seize the opportunities available in urban contexts. At the same time, a housing sector that performs well acts as a ‘development multiplier’ benefiting complementary industries, contributing to economic development, employment generation, service provision and overall poverty reduction. Broadly, for every job in the house-building sector, an additional 1.5 to 2 jobs are generally created in the construction materials and other input industries. The contributions of housing to urban prosperity are also evident. The UN-Habitat City Prosperity Initiative reveals indicates that inadequate housing has negative effects on several other dimensions of urban prosperity. Urban contexts with housing conditions below average experience poorer equity and inclusion, reduced urban safety and livelihood opportunities, and have neglected connectivity and provision of public space.\n\nInadequate housing thus remains very much a global urban sustainability challenge but also development opportunity. At the same time, the thematic area of ‘adequate housing’ and especially the term ‘slums’ - are often highly politicized. More nuanced definitions of these terms would enable and support a more robust and measured debate, greater engagement by all key stakeholders and the development of specific recommendations for application within each context and place.\n\nIn order to develop a more nuanced definition, there are a number of interrelated terms that must be grappled with when considering an indicator for the SDG Target 11.1. They include inadequate housing and housing affordability, informal settlements and slums.\n\n## Housing affordability\n\nOne of the most daunting challenges of urbanization globally has been the provision of adequate housing that people can afford. Findings from the UN Global Sample of Cities {^1} show that people across all types of urban centres are not able to afford home ownership or even the cost of rental housing. In low-income countries for example, households need to save the equivalent of nearly eight times their annual household income in order to be able to afford the price of a standard house in their town or city. If they rent, households have to commit more than 25 per cent of their monthly income to rent payments.  [^2]\n\nThe affordability issue is affecting the developing and developed worlds alike. In Latin America, high house price-to-income ratio and inaccessible housing finance compel households to resort to informal solutions without the benefits of planning and safety regulations. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, less than 10 per cent of households are able to afford a mortgage for even the cheapest newly built house. In fact, African households face 55 per cent higher housing costs relative to their per capita GDP than in other regions. [^3]  In many European countries, families, especially the youth, are severely cost burdened and have much less to spend on other necessities such as food, health, transport and clothing. In extreme circumstances, households are forced to leave their accommodation because of the inability to pay. The current migration crisis has worsened housing conditions in the region, a trend that seems set to continue in the next few years.\n\n## Inadequate housing, informal settlements and slums\n\nToday, an estimated 1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing globally, of which 1 billion live in slums and informal settlements. [^4] This means that about one in four people in cities live in conditions that harm their health, safety, prosperity and opportunities. Lack of access to basic services is a common constraint in informal settlements and slums: worldwide 2.4 billion people live without improved sanitation and 2 billion are affected by water stress. In spite of a decrease from 39 to 30 per cent of urban population living in slums between 2000 and 2014, absolute numbers continue to grow: currently, one quarter of the world’s urban population is estimated to live in slums, 881 million urban residents as opposed to 792 million in 2000.  Young women- and children-headed households are often the most vulnerable to inadequate housing conditions. Homelessness is also a growing challenge and it is estimated that more than 100 million people worldwide are homeless.

Research shows that other forms of urban poverty in the form of informal settlements increasingly become a worldwide phenomenon found also in the developed world.\n\nAt the same time, not all people who live in inadequate housing live in slums but are nonetheless living in very substandard conditions in the urban contexts in which they are situated. The nature of these unsatisfactory living conditions must be captured and better represented in the global, country and city-level data to ensure a more robust picture of inadequate housing is documented. In light of this, the following definitions are proposed.\n\n## Definition and concept\n\nAs per the 2030 Agenda, to guide the development of the appropriate policies and programmes for ensuring access for all to adequate housing and the upgrading of slums, it is necessary to identify and quantify the proportion of the population that live in slums, informal settlements and those living in inadequate housing.\n\n## Slums\n\n**a.

Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities,\n3. Lack of sufficient living area,\n4. Lack of housing durability and,\n5. Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term ‘slum dweller’ refers to a person living in a household that lacks any of the above attributes.

The three criteria of informal settlements are essentially captured in the definition of slums, which sustains the combination of both (slums/informal settlements). From the seven criteria of adequate housing, the three that are not covered by slums / informal settlements are affordability, accessibility and cultural adequacy. For the purpose of composing an indicator, affordability is the most relevant and easier to measure.\n\nThus, in order to come up with a composite indicator, the metadata for the SDG Indicator 11.1.1 is proposing to group the definition of slums and informal settlements, to allow for comparison with MDGs, and add the element of affordability from the definition of adequate housing.\n\nIn this regard, housing affordability is not only a key housing adequacy criterion, but is a suitable means of measuring inadequate housing in a more encompassing manner, as it remains a global challenge across different countries and income levels, with strong negative impact on urban inequality.\nThe underlying principle is that household financial costs associated with housing should not threaten or compromise the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs such as, food, education, access to health care, transport, etc. Based on the existing method and data of UN-Habitat’s Urban Indicators Program (1996-2006), unaffordability is currently measured as the net monthly expenditure on housing cost that exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household.\n\nThus, Indicator 11.1.1 is expected to be a **composite one**, with the main components of slum/informal settlements’ and the added component of affordability defining inadequate housing. Table 1 details the proposed definition of Slum/Informal Settlements and Inadequate Housing as well as the respective measurements.\n\n### Table 1 – Definition and measurement criteria for slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing\n\n# Slums / Informal Settlements\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nAs adopted in the MDG, household where the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following ‘household deprivations’: 1) Lack of access to improved water source, 2) Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, 3) Lack of sufficient living area, 4) Lack of housing durability and, 5) Lack of security of tenure).\n\n## MEASUREMENT [^12]:\n\n### Security of Tenure\n\n* Proportion of households with formal title deeds to both land and residence.\n* Proportion of households with formal title deeds to either one of land or residence.\n* Proportion of households with agreements or any document as a proof of a tenure arrangement.\n\n### Adequate water\n\nA settlement has an inadequate drinking water supply if less than 50% of households have an improved water supply:\n\n* household connection;\n* access to public stand pipe;\n* rainwater collection; with at least 20 liters/person/day available within an acceptable collection distance.\n\n### Access to sanitation\n\nA settlement has inadequate sanitation if less than 50% of households have improved sanitation:\n\n* public sewer;\n* septic tank;\n* pour-flush latrine;\n* Ventilated improved pit latrine.\n\nThe excreta disposal system is considered adequate if it is private or shared by a maximum of two households.\n\n### Structural quality of Housing and location\n\nProportion of households residing on or near a hazardous site. The following locations should be considered:\n\n* housing in geologically hazardous zones (landslide/earthquake and flood areas);\n* housing on or under garbage mountains;\n* housing around high-industrial pollution areas;\n* housing around other unprotected high-risk zones (e.g. railroads, airports, energy transmission lines).\n\n### Structural quality of the housing and permanency of the structure\n\nProportion of households living in temporary and/or dilapidated structures. The following factors should be considered when placing a housing unit in these categories:\n\n* quality of construction (e.g. materials used for wall, floor and roof);\n* compliance with local building codes, standards and bylaws.\n\n### Sufficient living area / Overcrowding\n\n* Proportion of households with more than two persons per room.\n\n# Inadequate housing\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nProposed to complement the slums/informal settlements measuring affordability of housing at the global level.\n\n## MEASUREMENT\n\n### Affordability\n\n* Proportion of households with net monthly expenditure on housing exceeding 30% of the total monthly income of the household.\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nAs with all indicators, there are a number of potential challenges and limitations. Some of these are outlined below.\n\n* Difficulties to agree universally on some definitions and characteristics when referring to deteriorated housing conditions, often due to political or economic considerations.\n* Lack of appropriate tools at national and city levels to measure all components required by Indicator 11.1.1, sometimes resulting in the underestimation of deteriorated housing units.\n* The complicated relation between security of tenure with land and property makes it a difficult, but vital, aspect to include in the different surveys, and thus, to measure and monitor.\n* Indicator 11.1.1 does not capture homelessness.\n* Many countries still have limited capacities for data collection, management and analysis, their update and monitoring. These are key to ensure national and global data consistency.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation method\n\nThe indicator considers two components to be computed as follows:\n\na) Slum/Informal Settlements households (SISH):\n\n<math>\n  <mo>=</mo>\n  <mn>100</mn>\n  <mfenced>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mi>Number of people living in SISH households</mi>\n      <mi>City population</mi>\n    </mfrac>\n  </mfenced>\n</math>\n\nb) Inadequate housing households (IHH):\n\n<math>\n  <mo>=</mo>\n  <mn>100</mn>\n  <mfenced>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mi>Number of people living in IHH</mi>\n      <mi>City population</mi>\n    </mfrac>\n  </mfenced>\n</math>\n\nThe unit of measurements for all these indicators will be %. Currently, the data for this indicator is already being reported in nearly all developing countries on what refers to slums and informal settlements, and in some countries for what refers to expenditure on housing. The SDG indicator 11.1.1 will therefore contribute to report on a broader spectrum of inadequate housing conditions affecting households in all countries.\n\n## Disaggregation [^13]\n\n### Potential disaggregation\n* Disaggregation by location (intra-urban)\n* Disaggregation by income group\n* Disaggregation by sex, race, ethnicity, religion, migration status (head of household)\n* Disaggregation by age (household members)\n* Disaggregation by disability (household members)\n\n### Quantifiable Derivatives:\n* Proportion of households with durable housing\n* Proportion of households with improved water\n* Proportion of households with improved sanitation\n* Proportion of households with sufficient living space\n* Proportion of households with security of tenure\n* Proportion of households with one (1) housing deprivation\n* Proportion of households with multiple (3 or more) housing deprivations\n* Proportion of households with approved municipal permit\n* Proportion of households with (in) adequate housing (affordability)\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n* **At country level**\n\n    All countries are expected to fully report on this indicator more consistently with few challenges where missing values will be reported at the national/global level. At the national level, it is possible that missing values will be recorded perhaps representing gaps of non-measurements among populations whose status of slum-hood or informality or inadequate housing is not recorded, unknown or where data is unavailable. Because the values will be aggregated at the national levels, missing values will be less observed at these levels, but are likely to affect the estimates. At the survey and data collection level, survey procedures for managing missing values will be applied based on the unit of analysis/ primary sampling units.\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Global estimates will be adjusted with modelling based on trends to cater for missing information or data.\n\n## Regional aggregates\n\nRegional and global estimates will be derived from national figures with an appropriate disaggregation level. Specialized tools will be developed and agreed upon with local and international stakeholders. Systems of quality assurance on the use of the tools, analysis and reporting will be deployed regionally, and global to ensure that standards are uniform and that definitions are universally applied.\n\nWe expect that investments in improved data collection and monitoring at country level will produce incentives for governments to improve reporting and performance and also greater readiness to engage with multiple stakeholders in data collection and analysis and in achieving better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of existing slum definitions and their applications.\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nAs national agencies are responsible for data collection, no differences between country produced data and international estimated data on the indicator are expected to arise if standard methodologies and procedures are followed at all stages of the reporting process.  Missing data and other local variables and frequency of data collection usually affects the figures reported at the global and national level. For this indicator, national data will be used to derive global figures. In instances where global values differ from national figures, efforts will be made for harmonization.\n\n# Data sources\n\n## Sources and data collection\n\nData for the slum/informal settlements components of the indicator can be computed from Census and national household surveys, including DHS and MICS. Data for the inadequate housing component can be computed through income and household surveys that capture housing expenditures.\n\nAs per all the agreed Agenda 2030’s goals and targets, to measure the achievement of this indicator will require the mobilisation of means required to efficiently monitor them, calling for revitalised partnerships with the participation of all countries, all stakeholders and all communities concerned.\n\nFor primary reporting, national data providers (especially the Statistical agencies) will play an important role generating the primary data through census and surveys. Regional and global estimates will be derived from national figures with appropriate disaggregation. Specialized tools will be developed and agreed upon with local and international stakeholders. Quality assurance on the use of the tools, analysis and reporting will be deployed regionally and globally, to ensure that standards are uniform and that definitions are universally applied.\n\n# Data availability\n\n## Description\n\nData on slums is available for all developing countries, as it has been reported yearly by UN-Habitat in the MDGs’ reports. Recently, UN-Habitat has disaggregated information on this indicator at city level, increasing its suitability for SDG 11. The people living in slums’ indicator is currently measured in more than 320 cities across the world as part of UN-Habitat City Prosperity Initiative. UN-Habitat and World Bank computed this indicator for many years (1996-2006) as part of the Urban Indicators Programme. Data on inadequate housing, measured through housing affordability, is available for all OECED countries as well as in UN Global Sample of Cities covering 200 cities. Data on inadequate housing, measured through housing affordability, is available in many countries. UN-Habitat and World Bank computed this indicator for many years (1996-2006) as part of the Urban Indicators Programme. Recently, the Global Housing Indicators Working Group, a collaborative effort of Cities Alliance, Habitat for Humanity International, the Inter-American Development Bank, UN-Habitat proposed the collection of data on this indicator worldwide.\n\n# Calendar\n\nAll major surveys and census data collection process will continue to incorporate the aspects/components necessary for reporting on this indicator. The monitoring of this indicator will be repeated at regular intervals of 3-5 years, allowing for three-five year reporting points until the year 2030.\n\n# Data providers and compilers\n\nThis indicator has largely been successfully due to the collaborations between several organizations and institutions including UN- Habitat, UNEP, Cities Alliance, Slum dwellers International, and World Bank. There are several other experts who have also contributed to the development of the concepts, rationale and definitions, and metadata and will also support measurement, reporting and policy dialogue at the country level, based on the indicators.\n\nFor primary reporting, National data provider especially the Statistical agencies will play an important role of generation of the primary data through census and surveys. Final Compilation & reporting at the global level will be lead and guided by UN-Habitat with support from selected partners.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliographic References\n* United Nations (2007).

One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas.\n\nNote that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage.","CLASS_SYSTEM":"## Concepts\n\nProtected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:\n\n* Category Ia: Strict nature reserve\n* Category Ib: Wilderness area\n* Category II: National park\n* Category III: Natural monument or feature\n* Category IV: Habitat/species management area\n* Category V: Protected landscape/seascape\n* Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources\n\nThe status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military).\n\nSites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world’s countries (BirdLife International 2014). The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems was approved by IUCN (2016).","COLL_METHOD":"## Collection process\n\nSee information under other sections.","COMPILING_ORG":"# Data compilers\n\n## Name\n\nUNEP-WCMC and IUCN\n\n## Description\n\nProtected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through [Protected Planet](http://www.protectedplanet.net/), which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016). Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the [World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas](http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/), managed by BirdLife International (2017). Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are available online at [BirdLife International (2016)](http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/site/search) and data on Alliance for Zero Extinction sites are available online at [AZE (2010)](http://www.zeroextinction.org/). Both datasets, along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the [Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login).","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"# References\n\n## URL\n\nhttp://www.unep-wcmc.org/; http://www.birdlife.org/; http://www.iucn.org/","DATA_AVAILABILITY":"# Data availability\n\n## Description\n\nThis indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis.","DATA_COMP":"# Methodology\n\n## Computation method\n\nThis indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2017) and digital polygons for marine Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the [Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login)). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.\n\nYear of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. In 2017 we slightly changed the methods described by Butchart et al. (2012, 2015) by randomly assigning a year to protected areas with no year of establishment before calculating trends in coverage. This is a computationally more efficient method and is likely to reflect more accurately changes in protected area coverage over time.\n\nPreviously the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered.","DATA_SOURCE":"# Data providers\n\nProtected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Key Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds.","DISAGGREGATION":"## Disaggregation\n\nGiven that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I–VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.\n\nIn addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for marine biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 14.5, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include:\n\nSDG 15.1.2 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.\nSDG 15.4.1 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity.\n\nProtected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with eco-regional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space.","DOC_METHOD":"## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level\n\nThe WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are available here: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas. The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003 and 2014 which have resulted in a global network of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014>). Protected areas data is therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual>) made available through www.protectedplanet.net where all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded.   The process for compilation of data on sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity (Key Biodiversity Areas) is documented online (http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home). Specifically, (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas>), the Key Biodiversity Area identification process is a highly inclusive, consultative and bottom-up exercise. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. Key Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key Biodiversity Areas, including those identified as Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national organisations (<http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners>), for the Alliance for Zero Extinction by 93 national and international organisations (<http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html>), and as other Key Biodiversity Areas by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (<http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx>), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites. Any site proposal undergoes independent scientific review. This is followed by the official site nomination with full documentation meeting the Documentation Standards for Key Biodiversity Areas. Sites confirmed by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas then appear on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>).\n\nThe WDPA User Manual (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual>)  published in English, Spanish, and French provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, what are the benefits of providing such data, which are the data standards and which quality checks are performed. We also provide a summary of our methods to calculate protected areas coverage to all WDPA users: <https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage>. The “Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas” (<https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259>) comprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, with further guidelines available on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>). Specifically (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved>), the main steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the following:\n\ni) submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area to Regional Focal Points;<br>\nii) Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified Key Biodiversity Areas in the country, either through national Key Biodiversity Area Coordination Groups or independently;<br>\niii) review of proposed Key Biodiversity Areas by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and<br>\niv) a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat (see section 3.3 below).\n\nOnce a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the Key Biodiversity Areas Community to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples.","FREQ_COLL":"# Calendar\n\n## Data collection\n\nUNEP-WCMC produces the UN List of Protected Areas every 5–10 years, based on information provided by national ministries/agencies. In the intervening period between compilations of UN Lists, UNEP-WCMC works closely with national ministries/agencies and NGOs responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas, continually updating the WDPA as new data become available. The World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas is also updated on an ongoing basis, as new national data are submitted.","IMPUTATION":"## Treatment of missing values\n* **At country level**\n\n    Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world’s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary.\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas.

The process of identification of Key Biodiversity Areas is supported by the Key Biodiversity Areas Partnership (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners>). Among the roles of the partnership is establishment of the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat, which checks information submitted in the Site Nomination phase for the correct application of the Key Biodiversity Areas Standard (<https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259>), and the adequacy of site documentation and then verifies the site, which is then published on the Key Biodiversity Areas Website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved>). In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and World Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN Membership of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an independent Key Biodiversity Areas Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas. The R code for calculating protected area coverage of KBAs is documented as Dias, M. (2017) “R code for calculating protected area coverage of KBAs”. (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf>).\n\nIn addition to dissemination via the Protected Planet website (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/>), the UN List process described in 3.1 the fact that protected areas data is collected from national agencies acknowledged in the WDPA metadata, and Key Biodiversity Areas website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>), Protected Planet and Key Biodiversity Areas data are disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, available for research and conservation online (<https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/>). This incorporates Country Profile documents for all of the world’s countries, which includes documentation of the indicator of protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas for the current year, starting from 2016. The first edition of each of these Country Profiles was sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (<https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml>), at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity; and this process will be repeated annually.","RATIONALE":"## Rationale\n\nThe safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of marine natural resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type.\n\nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.\n\nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al.\n2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.\n\nThe indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011–2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010).","REC_USE_LIM":"## Comments and limitations\n\nQuality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas.

UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator.\n\nImportant Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way.\n\nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability (holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of the target species, for at least one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at which species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species).\n\nThe Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide. Hence, they represent important areas to consider designating as formal protected areas.","REL_CAL_POLICY":"## Data release\n\nThe indicator of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity is anticipated to be released annually.","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"# Institutional information\n\n## Organization(s)\n\nUN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)<br>\nBirdLife International (BLI)<br>\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)","SDG_GOAL":"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","SDG_INDICATOR":"Indicator 14.5.1: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"## Time series\n\n~150 years","SDG_TARGET":"Target 14.5: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information","SOURCE_TYPE":"# Data sources\n\n## Description\n\nProtected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Protected Areas data for sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant convention international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through [Protected Planet](http://www.protectedplanet.net/), which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016).\n\nKey Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds. Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the [World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas](http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/), managed by BirdLife International. Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are available online at [BirdLife International (2016)](http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/site/search) and data on Alliance for Zero Extinction sites are available online at [AZE (2010)](http://www.zeroextinction.org/). Both datasets, along with Key Biodiversity Areas identified through other processes, are available through the [World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas](http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/), and along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the [Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login).","STAT_CONC_DEF":"# Concepts and definitions\n\n## Definition\n\nThe indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for marine biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas.","TRANS_SOURCE":"NA","full":"14.5.1\n\nTue Jul 11 2017 08:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)\n\nENG\n\nNA\n\nGoal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development\n\nTarget 14.5: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information\n\nIndicator 14.5.1: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas\n\n# Institutional information\n\n## Organization(s)\n\nUN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)<br>\nBirdLife International (BLI)<br>\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\n\n# Concepts and definitions\n\n## Definition\n\nThe indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for marine biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of marine natural resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type.\n\nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.\n\nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al.\n2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.\n\nThe indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011–2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010).\n\n## Concepts\n\nProtected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:\n\n* Category Ia: Strict nature reserve\n* Category Ib: Wilderness area\n* Category II: National park\n* Category III: Natural monument or feature\n* Category IV: Habitat/species management area\n* Category V: Protected landscape/seascape\n* Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources\n\nThe status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military).\n\nSites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world’s countries (BirdLife International 2014). The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems was approved by IUCN (2016).\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nQuality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2016) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.\n\nThe indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11\n(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to “green listing” have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.\n\nData and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, “other effective area-based conservation measures”, as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target\n11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et al. 2014). However, standard approaches to documentation of “other effective area-based conservation measures” are still under debate through the IUCN Task Force on Other Effective Areas Based Conservation Measures which will conclude with recommendations for a definition on OECMs. Once defined it is likely OEMCs will be documented in the World Database on Protected Areas.\n\nRegarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012).\n\nKey Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or “irreplaceability”) using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).\n\nFuture developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of marine Key Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of marine vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) exploring other methods for assessing and presenting temporal trends in protected area coverage.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation method\n\nThis indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2017) and digital polygons for marine Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the [Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login)). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.\n\nYear of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. In 2017 we slightly changed the methods described by Butchart et al. (2012, 2015) by randomly assigning a year to protected areas with no year of establishment before calculating trends in coverage. This is a computationally more efficient method and is likely to reflect more accurately changes in protected area coverage over time.\n\nPreviously the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nGiven that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I–VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.\n\nIn addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for marine biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 14.5, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include:\n\nSDG 15.1.2 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.\nSDG 15.4.1 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity.\n\nProtected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with eco-regional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space.\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n* **At country level**\n\n    Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world’s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary.\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation.\n\n## Regional aggregates\n\nUNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator.\n\nImportant Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way.\n\nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability (holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of the target species, for at least one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at which species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species).\n\nThe Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide. Hence, they represent important areas to consider designating as formal protected areas.\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nNational processes provide the great bulk of the data that are subsequently aggregated into both the World Database on Protected Areas and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are very few differences between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas.\n\nNote that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage.\n\n## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level\n\nThe WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are available here: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas. The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003 and 2014 which have resulted in a global network of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014>). Protected areas data is therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual>) made available through www.protectedplanet.net where all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded.   The process for compilation of data on sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity (Key Biodiversity Areas) is documented online (http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home). Specifically, (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas>), the Key Biodiversity Area identification process is a highly inclusive, consultative and bottom-up exercise. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. Key Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key Biodiversity Areas, including those identified as Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national organisations (<http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners>), for the Alliance for Zero Extinction by 93 national and international organisations (<http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html>), and as other Key Biodiversity Areas by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (<http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx>), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites. Any site proposal undergoes independent scientific review. This is followed by the official site nomination with full documentation meeting the Documentation Standards for Key Biodiversity Areas. Sites confirmed by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas then appear on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>).\n\nThe WDPA User Manual (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual>)  published in English, Spanish, and French provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, what are the benefits of providing such data, which are the data standards and which quality checks are performed. We also provide a summary of our methods to calculate protected areas coverage to all WDPA users: <https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage>. The “Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas” (<https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259>) comprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, with further guidelines available on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>). Specifically (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved>), the main steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the following:\n\ni) submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area to Regional Focal Points;<br>\nii) Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified Key Biodiversity Areas in the country, either through national Key Biodiversity Area Coordination Groups or independently;<br>\niii) review of proposed Key Biodiversity Areas by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and<br>\niv) a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat (see section 3.3 below).\n\nOnce a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the Key Biodiversity Areas Community to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples.\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nThe process on how the data is collected, standardised and published is available in the WDPA User Manual at: <https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual> which is available in English, French and Spanish. Specific guidance is provided at <https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas> on, for example, predefined fields or look up tables in the WDPA: <https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables>, how WDPA records are coded how international designations  and regional designations data is collected, how regularly is the database updated, and how to perform protected areas coverage statistics. The process of identification of Key Biodiversity Areas is supported by the Key Biodiversity Areas Partnership (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners>). Among the roles of the partnership is establishment of the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat, which checks information submitted in the Site Nomination phase for the correct application of the Key Biodiversity Areas Standard (<https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259>), and the adequacy of site documentation and then verifies the site, which is then published on the Key Biodiversity Areas Website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved>). In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and World Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN Membership of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an independent Key Biodiversity Areas Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas. The R code for calculating protected area coverage of KBAs is documented as Dias, M. (2017) “R code for calculating protected area coverage of KBAs”. (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf>).\n\nIn addition to dissemination via the Protected Planet website (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/>), the UN List process described in 3.1 the fact that protected areas data is collected from national agencies acknowledged in the WDPA metadata, and Key Biodiversity Areas website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>), Protected Planet and Key Biodiversity Areas data are disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, available for research and conservation online (<https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/>). This incorporates Country Profile documents for all of the world’s countries, which includes documentation of the indicator of protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas for the current year, starting from 2016. The first edition of each of these Country Profiles was sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (<https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml>), at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity; and this process will be repeated annually.\n\n# Data sources\n\n## Description\n\nProtected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Protected Areas data for sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant convention international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through [Protected Planet](http://www.protectedplanet.net/), which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016).\n\nKey Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds. Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the [World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas](http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/), managed by BirdLife International. Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are available online at [BirdLife International (2016)](http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/site/search) and data on Alliance for Zero Extinction sites are available online at [AZE (2010)](http://www.zeroextinction.org/). Both datasets, along with Key Biodiversity Areas identified through other processes, are available through the [World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas](http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/), and along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the [Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login).\n\n## Collection process\n\nSee information under other sections.\n\n# Data availability\n\n## Description\n\nThis indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Time series\n\n~150 years\n\n# Calendar\n\n## Data collection\n\nUNEP-WCMC produces the UN List of Protected Areas every 5–10 years, based on information provided by national ministries/agencies. In the intervening period between compilations of UN Lists, UNEP-WCMC works closely with national ministries/agencies and NGOs responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas, continually updating the WDPA as new data become available. The World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas is also updated on an ongoing basis, as new national data are submitted.\n\n## Data release\n\nThe indicator of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity is anticipated to be released annually.\n\n# Data providers\n\nProtected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas.

These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website: www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology\n\nA gift or an informal payment is considered a ‘bribe’.","COLL_METHOD":"## Collection process\n\nThe World Bank conducts the Enterprise Surveys in client countries. The surveys are comparable as the survey methodology is applied in a consistent manner across countries: obtaining suitable sample frames, eligibility criteria for respondent firms, survey sample design, core questionnaire elements across every country, standardized QC checks on the received data, standardized computation of sampling weights, etc.","COMPILING_ORG":"# Data compilers\n\n## Name\n\nWorld Bank","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"# References\n\n## URL\n\nwww.worldbank.org","DATA_AVAILABILITY":"# Data Availability\n\n## Description\n\nData Availability 2010 to present (in terms of countries having at least 1 data point after 2010 for this indicator):\nAsia and Pacific: 28; Africa: 25; Latin America and Caribbean: 30; Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 22.","DATA_COMP":"# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nThe indicator is calculated for each country, by looking at the proportion of firms which answered ‘yes’ to the survey question. For all Enterprise Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has sampling weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata, incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata.","DATA_SOURCE":"# Data providers\n\nThe indicator is derived from Enterprise Surveys which are conducted by the World Bank. The World Bank usually hires a private contractor (typically a market research company) to conduct the survey fieldwork.","DISAGGREGATION":"## Disaggregation\n\nThe Enterprise Survey captures several descriptive characteristics of the respondent firms including: gender of top manager, primary business activity of the firm, subnational location of the firm, exporting status, number of employees, degree of foreign ownership, and several other characteristics. Hence the indicator can be disaggregated by the levels of these individual characteristics.","DOC_METHOD":"## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level\n\nWe recommend users consult the Enterprise Surveys website to learn about the overall survey methodology and learn which countries are available for benchmarking purposes.  <http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology>","FREQ_COLL":"# Calendar\n\n## Data collection\n\nThe Surveys are ongoing.

A single point estimate is created for each country and a global/regional aggregate takes a simple average of every country’s point estimate (when there is available data for that country). For example the East Asia Pacific average (point estimate) for the indicator does not include Japan since there is no Enterprise Survey for Japan.","LANGUAGE":"ENG","META_LAST_UPDATE":"July 11, 2017","META_PAGE":"16.5.2","QUALITY_ASSURE":"## Quality assurance\n\nWhen conducting our survey projects, the implementing fieldwork team must send periodic batches of completed interviews to the World Bank so that we can run our own quality control programs on the data.  After running these programs, we provide the QC feedback to the implementing fieldwork team so that survey data, which has been flagged, can be verified and continuously improved.  This is how we continuously monitor the survey data while the projects are in the field.\n\nThe World Bank collects this survey data for the public good of information.  For an individual survey project, once the data is collected and considered finalized (after our own internal QC processes), the survey data is published on the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys website.","RATIONALE":"## Rationale\n\nThe rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are solicited for gifts or informal payments (i.e. bribes) when meeting with tax officials. Paying taxes are required of formal forms in most countries and hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of corruption during this routine interaction. The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s reality.","REC_USE_LIM":"## Comments and limitations\n\nThe key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s reality.\n\nThe limitations include that some countries’ data is almost 10 years old (e.g. South Africa and Brazil). This is due to the fact that these face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence due to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn’t been able to update some of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation is that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and hence most high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, Canada, Western European countries, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).\n\nAnother limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on corruption.

The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment as well as firm’s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are solicited for gifts or informal payments (i.e. bribes) when meeting with tax officials. Paying taxes are required of formal forms in most countries and hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of corruption during this routine interaction. The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s reality.\n\n## Concepts\n\nThe respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or services establishments. These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website: www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology\n\nA gift or an informal payment is considered a ‘bribe’.\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nThe key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s reality.\n\nThe limitations include that some countries’ data is almost 10 years old (e.g. South Africa and Brazil). This is due to the fact that these face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence due to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn’t been able to update some of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation is that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and hence most high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, Canada, Western European countries, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).\n\nAnother limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on corruption. Although the data is collected under the context of confidentiality, firms may refuse to answer the question if they have been subject to bribery solicitations. Hence, in some countries, the actual incidence of this particular type of corruption may be higher than the calculated indicator value.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nThe indicator is calculated for each country, by looking at the proportion of firms which answered ‘yes’ to the survey question. For all Enterprise Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has sampling weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata, incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nThe Enterprise Survey captures several descriptive characteristics of the respondent firms including: gender of top manager, primary business activity of the firm, subnational location of the firm, exporting status, number of employees, degree of foreign ownership, and several other characteristics. Hence the indicator can be disaggregated by the levels of these individual characteristics.\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At country level**\n\n    The indicator value is not imputed for countries which do not have an Enterprise Survey.\n\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    Regional and global aggregates of the indicator are derived from completed surveys. A single point estimate is created for each country and a global/regional aggregate takes a simple average of every country’s point estimate (when there is available data for that country). For example the East Asia Pacific average (point estimate) for the indicator does not include Japan since there is no Enterprise Survey for Japan.\n\n## Regional aggregates\n\nRegional and global aggregates are computed by taking the simple average of the indicator value for all relevant countries. When producing regional and global aggregates as presented on the Enterprise Surveys website, note that only surveys posted during years 2010 onwards are used.\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nWe are unaware of any country-produced data on this indicator\n\n## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level\n\nWe recommend users consult the Enterprise Surveys website to learn about the overall survey methodology and learn which countries are available for benchmarking purposes.  <http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology>\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nWhen conducting our survey projects, the implementing fieldwork team must send periodic batches of completed interviews to the World Bank so that we can run our own quality control programs on the data.  After running these programs, we provide the QC feedback to the implementing fieldwork team so that survey data, which has been flagged, can be verified and continuously improved.  This is how we continuously monitor the survey data while the projects are in the field.\n\nThe World Bank collects this survey data for the public good of information.  For an individual survey project, once the data is collected and considered finalized (after our own internal QC processes), the survey data is published on the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys website.\n\n# Data Sources\n\n## Description\n\nThe website for Enterprise Surveys (www.enterprisesurveys.org) provides all metadata, including survey questionnaires and implementation reports for all Enterprise Surveys. The implementation reports indicate the sample size, sample frame used, dates/duration of fieldwork, the response rates, etc.\n\nRegistration to the Enterprise Survey’s website is free and the website’s data portal allows users to access the raw data and survey documentation for each survey.\n\n## Collection process\n\nThe World Bank conducts the Enterprise Surveys in client countries. The surveys are comparable as the survey methodology is applied in a consistent manner across countries: obtaining suitable sample frames, eligibility criteria for respondent firms, survey sample design, core questionnaire elements across every country, standardized QC checks on the received data, standardized computation of sampling weights, etc.\n\n# Data Availability\n\n## Description\n\nData Availability 2010 to present (in terms of countries having at least 1 data point after 2010 for this indicator):\nAsia and Pacific: 28; Africa: 25; Latin America and Caribbean: 30; Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 22.\n\n# Calendar\n\n## Data collection\n\nThe Surveys are ongoing.

The underlying data are regularly produced by countries, and there is current data available. From the IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification description at <https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/>, a key criteria is that “data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries”. The IMF GFS database, with 120+ regular annual reporting countries using the same reporting format meets this key criteria. Apart from conflict countries, all IMF member countries produce revenue (and expenditure) data for surveillance purposes. In the 2017 round of soliciting annual GFS series from countries, we have specifically encouraged those countries that were non-reporters over the past few years to (at a minimum) provide the key revenue and expenditure series needed to monitor 17.1.","DATA_COMP":"# Methodology\n\n## Computation method\n\nIndicator 17.1.1 will be derived using series that are basic to the GFS reporting framework. GFS revenue series maintained by the IMF Statistics Department are collected in Table 1 of the standard annual data questionnaire. Each revenue transaction is classified according to whether it is a tax or another type of revenue. GFS revenue aggregates are summations of individual entries and elements in this particular class of flows and allow for these data to be arranged in a manageable and analytically useful way. For example, tax revenue is the sum of all flows that are classified as taxes. Conceptually, the value for each main revenue aggregate is the sum of the values for all items in the relevant category. The annual GFS series for monitoring Indicator 17.1.1will be derived from the data reported by the national authorities (in national currency) expressed as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), where GDP is derived from the IMF World Economic Outlook database (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor will the calculation change over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities in the underlying series as these are key aggregates/ components in all country reported GFS series). The presentation will closely align with that currently contained in World Table 4 from the hard-copy GFS Yearbook:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">Total Revenue (% GDP)</td>\n   <td colspan=\"7\">of which: Taxes</td>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">of which: Social contributions</td>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">of which: Grants</td>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">of which: Other revenue</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains</td>\n   <td>Taxes on payroll and workforce</td>\n   <td>Taxes on property</td>\n   <td>Taxes on goods and services</td>\n   <td>Taxes on international trade and transactions</td>\n   <td>Other taxes</td>\n   <td>Total</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nHistoric series have been aligned with GFSM 2014 classifications.

In addition to revenue mobilization, government units may also finance a portion of their activities in a specific period by borrowing or by acquiring funds from sources other than compulsory transfers—for example, interest revenue, incidental sales of goods and services, or the rent of subsoil assets. Indicator 17.1.1 Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source supports understanding countries’ domestic revenue mobilization in the form of tax and nontax sources. The indicator will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset that highlights the relationship between the four main types of revenue as well as the relative \"tax burden\" (revenue in the form of taxes) and “fiscal burden” (revenue in the form of taxes plus social contributions).","REC_USE_LIM":"## Comments and limitations\n\nIn principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially affect fiscal policies. Cross-country comparisons are ideally made with reference to the consolidated general government sector. However, for most developing and many emerging market economies, compiling data for the consolidated general government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability and/or timeliness of source data. For example, a country may have one central government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local governments. Countries may also have social security funds. The GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such general government units.

Similarly, there are some countries that report “consolidated central government” without necessarily providing the budgetary central government subsector separately. Conceptually, a World Aggregate could be calculated by computing a weighted average from available sources using GDP expressed in United States dollars. However, at this time the IMF Statistics Department recommends no regional and global aggregates be established. While we see no issues in terms of the feasibility and suitability of 17.1.1 for cross-country comparisons, we question the relevance of one single global indicator that combines data for advanced economies with those of emerging market and low-income countries. To address this, the country data are presented, where reported, for the budgetary central government, the consolidated central government (with and without social security funds), and for consolidated general government.\n\nFor many emerging market and low-income countries with limited statistical capacity, budgetary central government is considered the most appropriate level of institutional coverage for comparison purposes. Budgetary central government, as described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81), is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature.","REFERENCES":"## References\n\nThe GFSM 2014 is available at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/gfsm/.

These come from various national agencies (Ministries of Finance, Central Banks, National Statistics Offices, etc.) and are compiled according to a standardized method for data collection: the annual GFS Questionnaire. In the 2017 annual reporting cycle, 127 countries reported the relevant series for monitoring indicator 17.1.1. For current non-reporting countries that have demonstrated the capacity to compile and report the relevant GFS revenue series, the IMF Statistics Department is engaged in outreach to the national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed. Capacity Development activities will seek to address data deficiencies, including through regional workshops. The steps outlined above should allow, over time, for covering virtually the entire IMF membership.","STAT_CONC_DEF":"# Concepts and definitions\n\n## Definition\n\nRevenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of GFSM 2014 an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government units have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other resident or nonresident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee schemes.\n\n## Concepts\n\nThe transactions and the associated classifications are detailed in Chapter 5 of GFSM 2014 and are structured to demonstrate how general government (and public sector) units raise revenue. Only those taxes and social insurance contributions that are evidenced by tax assessments and declarations, customs declarations, and similar documents are considered to create revenue for government units. Thus, the difference between assessments and expected collections represents a claim that has no real value and should not be recorded as revenue (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 5.20). The analytic framework of GFSM 2014 (like that of the GFSM 2001) builds on the GFSM 1986 framework, and extends it by incorporating additional elements that are useful in assessing fiscal policy. An important example is the treatment of nonfinancial assets, where the sale of such assets is no longer included in revenue. The disposal of a nonfinancial asset by sale or barter is not revenue because it has no effect on net worth. Rather, it changes the composition of the balance sheet by exchanging one asset (the nonfinancial asset) for another (the proceeds of the sale). Similarly, amounts receivable from loan repayments and loan disbursements are not revenue. In general, transactions that increase net worth result from current operations. Capital transfers are an exception. In GFSM 2014, capital transfers receivable are classified as revenue because they increase the recipient’s net worth and they are often indistinguishable from current transfers in their effect on government operations. In recording cash-based accounting revenue transactions, data representing the tax payments received by government, net of refunds paid out during the period covered should be reported. These data will include taxes paid after the original assessment, taxes paid or refunds deducted from taxes after subsequent assessments, and taxes paid or refunds deducted after any subsequent reopening of the accounts. Therefore, total tax revenue could be presented on a gross basis as the total amount of all taxes accrued, or on a net basis as the gross amount minus tax refunds. Revenue categories are presented gross of expense categories for the same or related category. In particular, interest revenue is presented gross rather than as net interest expense or net interest revenue. Similarly, social benefits and social contributions, grant revenue and expense, and rent revenue and expense are presented gross. Also, sales of goods and services are presented gross of the expenses incurred in their production. In cases of erroneous or unauthorized transactions, revenue categories are presented net of refunds of the relevant revenue, and expense categories are presented net of inflows from the recovery of the expense. For example, refunds of income taxes may be paid when the amount of taxes withheld or otherwise paid in advance of the final determination exceeds the actual tax due. Such refunds are recorded as a reduction in tax revenue. For this reason, tax revenue is presented net of non-payable tax credits (see GFSM 2014 paragraphs 5.29–5.32).","TRANS_SOURCE":"NA","full":"17.1.1\n\nNovember 2017\n\nENG\n\nNA\n\nGoal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development\n\nTarget 17.1: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection\n\nIndicator 17.1.1: Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source\n\n# Institutional information\n\n## Organization(s)\n\nIMF Statistics Department (Government Finance Division)\n\n# Concepts and definitions\n\n## Definition\n\nRevenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of GFSM 2014 an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction.

In addition to revenue mobilization, government units may also finance a portion of their activities in a specific period by borrowing or by acquiring funds from sources other than compulsory transfers—for example, interest revenue, incidental sales of goods and services, or the rent of subsoil assets. Indicator 17.1.1 Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source supports understanding countries’ domestic revenue mobilization in the form of tax and nontax sources. The indicator will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset that highlights the relationship between the four main types of revenue as well as the relative \"tax burden\" (revenue in the form of taxes) and “fiscal burden” (revenue in the form of taxes plus social contributions).\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation method\n\nIndicator 17.1.1 will be derived using series that are basic to the GFS reporting framework. GFS revenue series maintained by the IMF Statistics Department are collected in Table 1 of the standard annual data questionnaire. Each revenue transaction is classified according to whether it is a tax or another type of revenue. GFS revenue aggregates are summations of individual entries and elements in this particular class of flows and allow for these data to be arranged in a manageable and analytically useful way. For example, tax revenue is the sum of all flows that are classified as taxes. Conceptually, the value for each main revenue aggregate is the sum of the values for all items in the relevant category. The annual GFS series for monitoring Indicator 17.1.1will be derived from the data reported by the national authorities (in national currency) expressed as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), where GDP is derived from the IMF World Economic Outlook database (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor will the calculation change over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities in the underlying series as these are key aggregates/ components in all country reported GFS series). The presentation will closely align with that currently contained in World Table 4 from the hard-copy GFS Yearbook:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">Total Revenue (% GDP)</td>\n   <td colspan=\"7\">of which: Taxes</td>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">of which: Social contributions</td>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">of which: Grants</td>\n   <td rowspan=\"2\">of which: Other revenue</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains</td>\n   <td>Taxes on payroll and workforce</td>\n   <td>Taxes on property</td>\n   <td>Taxes on goods and services</td>\n   <td>Taxes on international trade and transactions</td>\n   <td>Other taxes</td>\n   <td>Total</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nHistoric series have been aligned with GFSM 2014 classifications. This enhances the comparability of data across countries and ensures establishing robust analytical findings to support SDG monitoring using fiscal data.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nThe detailed GFS revenue classification structure in the annual questionnaire that is used by countries to report data allows for compiling 17.1.1.

We would appreciate further discussion with the IAEG SDGs on the merits of deriving regional or global aggregates from the country reported values for this indicator.\n\n# Data sources\n\n## Sources and data collection\n\nThe actual and recommended sources of data for deriving this indicator are the fiscal statistics reported to the IMF’s Statistics Department. These come from various national agencies (Ministries of Finance, Central Banks, National Statistics Offices, etc.) and are compiled according to a standardized method for data collection: the annual GFS Questionnaire. In the 2017 annual reporting cycle, 127 countries reported the relevant series for monitoring indicator 17.1.1. For current non-reporting countries that have demonstrated the capacity to compile and report the relevant GFS revenue series, the IMF Statistics Department is engaged in outreach to the national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed. Capacity Development activities will seek to address data deficiencies, including through regional workshops. The steps outlined above should allow, over time, for covering virtually the entire IMF membership.\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nIn principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially affect fiscal policies. Cross-country comparisons are ideally made with reference to the consolidated general government sector. However, for most developing and many emerging market economies, compiling data for the consolidated general government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability and/or timeliness of source data. For example, a country may have one central government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local governments. Countries may also have social security funds. The GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such general government units. This reporting structure is illustrated below:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"9\">General Government</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"3\">Memorandum Central Govt. (incl. SSF of central level)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"4\">Central Government (excluding social security funds)</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Social Security Funds</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">State Governments</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Local Governments</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Consolidation Column</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">General Government</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Budgetary</td>\n    <td>Extrabudgetary</td>\n    <td>Consolidation Column</td>\n    <td>Central Government</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>BA=GL1</td>\n    <td>EA</td>\n    <td>CC</td>\n    <td>CG</td>\n    <td>SSF</td>\n    <td>SG</td>\n    <td>LG</td>\n    <td>CT</td>\n    <td>GG=GL3</td>\n    <td>GL2</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome countries report data for the consolidated general government with one or more sub-sectors not separately reported. Similarly, there are some countries that report “consolidated central government” without necessarily providing the budgetary central government subsector separately. Conceptually, a World Aggregate could be calculated by computing a weighted average from available sources using GDP expressed in United States dollars. However, at this time the IMF Statistics Department recommends no regional and global aggregates be established. While we see no issues in terms of the feasibility and suitability of 17.1.1 for cross-country comparisons, we question the relevance of one single global indicator that combines data for advanced economies with those of emerging market and low-income countries. To address this, the country data are presented, where reported, for the budgetary central government, the consolidated central government (with and without social security funds), and for consolidated general government.\n\nFor many emerging market and low-income countries with limited statistical capacity, budgetary central government is considered the most appropriate level of institutional coverage for comparison purposes. Budgetary central government, as described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81), is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature.\n\n# Data Availability\n\n## Current data availability / indicator tier\n\nClassification of the indicator into one of the three tiers: We recommend that 17.1.1 (like 17.1.2) remain classified as Tier 1: The indicator is conceptually clear and internationally agreed standards for compiling components and aggregates are available. The underlying data are regularly produced by countries, and there is current data available. From the IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification description at <https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/>, a key criteria is that “data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries”. The IMF GFS database, with 120+ regular annual reporting countries using the same reporting format meets this key criteria. Apart from conflict countries, all IMF member countries produce revenue (and expenditure) data for surveillance purposes. In the 2017 round of soliciting annual GFS series from countries, we have specifically encouraged those countries that were non-reporters over the past few years to (at a minimum) provide the key revenue and expenditure series needed to monitor 17.1.\n\n# Calendar\n\n## Data collection and release calendar\n\nDates when source collection is next planned: IMF Statistics Department completed the 2017 round of annual GFS collection on February 2, 2018. The 2018 collection cycle is planned to take place between September and December 2018.\n\nCountry data are disseminated as they are processed and summary World Tables and other indicators, including 17.1.1 and 17.1.2 are planned for release in early 2018. For most countries, the reference year will be their Fiscal Year 2016 series, with 2012-2015 presented to illustrate trends.\n\n# Data compilers\n\nThe IMF Statistics Department (Government Finance Division; email: <mailto:STAGODATA@imf.org>) is the organization responsible for the compilation and reporting on this indicator at the global level.\n\n## References\n\nThe GFSM 2014 is available at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/gfsm/. A series of videos that discuss the GFS analytical framework are available at: IMF Statistics E-Learning Videos - YouTube. Although not foreseen under the reporting of 17.1.1, analysts can also use the detailed IMF GFS Revenue database to supplement this indicator with measures of direct, indirect and capital taxes (see GFSM 2014, Annex to Chapter 4).\n\n"},"17-3-2":{"CLASS_SYSTEM":"## Concepts\n\nPersonal remittances comprise of personal transfers and compensation of employees.

In most cases such data come from non-standard household surveys and  ex-post standardization processes can be designed to increase the degree of comparability across countries. For instance, regional teams from the World Bank produce standardized versions of raw datasets following common regional procedures: the ECAPOV harmonized datasets are based  on the Living Standards Measurement Study datasets – LSMS [^8] or household budget surveys (HBS) collected in the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia region; the SHIP collection results from a poverty program on harmonized household surveys in the World Bank’s African region, while the SHES collection was developed by the World Bank for the international comparison program . [^9] The Luxembourg income study (LIS) datasets results from effort to harmonize datasets from many high and middle-income countries. [^10] \n\nIn some cases the raw data is accessible to produce country level estimates. In some countries in addition to the raw data a standardized version of it is available and in other countries only the standardized version is. When multiple versions of the same survey are available the best performing in terms of a series of quality assurance tests is retained (see collection process). When a standardized version of a nationally designed survey instruments is chosen there are differences between expenditure variables generated using the raw data, and the expenditure variables generated using the harmonization procedures which might result in different estimated incidence of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of household total expenditure or income.","CLASS_SYSTEM":"## Concepts\n\nIndicator 3.8.2 is defined as the “Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income”. In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a threshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator).\n\n### Numerator\n\nHousehold expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, *from any type of provider and for all members of the household.* These health expenditures are characterized by a direct payments that are financed by a household’s income (including remittances), savings or loans  **but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement**. As such they only grant access to the health services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond the household [^1] and solely based on the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable source of funding for the health system.\n\nThe components of a household’s health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent with division 06 on health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) which currently  includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is being expanded. [^2]\n\nFurther information on definitions and classifications (for example by provider, by beneficiary characteristics) of health expenditures should be consistent with the [international classification for health accounts](http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/) and its family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the World Health Organization.\n\n### Denominator\n\nExpenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household’s long-term economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on domestic account during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure ‘consumption’ depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.\n\nThe most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services. [^3]\n\nIncome is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the “comments and limitations” section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see section on data sources).\n\n### Thresholds\n\nIt is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as share of total household consumption or income: **a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25)**. With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship (see section on comments and limitations).","COLL_METHOD":"## Collection process\n\nWHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed following their own guidelines either directly by them or by WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access to data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken.\n\nThe World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based on the following quality checks:\n\nFor the denominator of the health expenditure ratio\n\n* Compare the logarithm of  total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey.  Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet  if available, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI) , computed as the household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the comparison is with PovcalNet [^13] and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI [^14] the survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita.\n* Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet  at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion.\n* Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.\n\nFor the numerator of the health expenditure ratio\n* Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local currency.  When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the [Global Health Expenditure Database](http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/) (GHED) [^15] and the [World Development Indicators Database](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators) (WDI) [^16] . Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).\n\nThese benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff  et al 2018.\nAt the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any given indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country consultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and information on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft estimate was produced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available for 32 of them.\n\nIn addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and the methodology simple.  Results of such collaborations are not yet included in the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality assurance process just described.","COMPILING_ORG":"# Data compilers\n\nThe World Health Organization and the World Bank.","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"# References\n\n## URL:\n\n<http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp>;  <http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/>","DATA_AVAILABILITY":"# Data Availability\n\nThis indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the availability of information regarding health expenditures.

The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage indicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household’s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.\n\nIndicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of provider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who made the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or specific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to finance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received. \n\nThis is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a household’s capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. Some direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption or income.  For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection dimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please consult   Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on “Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report”.","REC_USE_LIM":"## Comments and limitations\n\nIt is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty. [^4} These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1.  However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.\n\nFirst, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). \nFor those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement – for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. \n\nClearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. \n\nSecond, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household’s resources (see concept section) but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based measures show a greater concentration  of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in  the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) .\n\nThird, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes ‘large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income’. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household’s budget to health. \n\nFourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending could also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services that are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. \n\nThere are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses  a framework  which includes , __in addition to indicator 3.8.2,__ a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending [^5} [^6} [^7}","REG_AGG":"## Regional aggregates\n\nTo construct regional and global level estimates, when survey-based estimates are not available for the reference years of 2000, 2005 or 2010 all survey-based estimates within a 5 year window of the reference year are “lined-up” by using a combination of interpolation, extrapolation, econometric modelling and imputation based on regional medians ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO and World Bank report on tracking universal health care coverage).\n\nThe World Bank and the World Health Organization use their own regional grouping, in addition to the regional breakdown proposed for the SDG by UNSD.","REL_CAL_POLICY":"## Data release\n\nEstimates on the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income was released on December 2017.

Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures – for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare measure . [^11] The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures.\n\nWhen socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2.  For any type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for cross-country comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this happens.

The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator).\n\n### Numerator\n\nHousehold expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, *from any type of provider and for all members of the household.* These health expenditures are characterized by a direct payments that are financed by a household’s income (including remittances), savings or loans  **but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement**. As such they only grant access to the health services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond the household [^1] and solely based on the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable source of funding for the health system.\n\nThe components of a household’s health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent with division 06 on health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) which currently  includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is being expanded. [^2]\n\nFurther information on definitions and classifications (for example by provider, by beneficiary characteristics) of health expenditures should be consistent with the [international classification for health accounts](http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/) and its family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the World Health Organization.\n\n### Denominator\n\nExpenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household’s long-term economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on domestic account during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure ‘consumption’ depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.\n\nThe most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services. [^3]\n\nIncome is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the “comments and limitations” section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see section on data sources).\n\n### Thresholds\n\nIt is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as share of total household consumption or income: **a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25)**. With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship (see section on comments and limitations).\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nIt is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty. [^4} These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1.  However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.\n\nFirst, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). \nFor those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement – for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. \n\nClearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. \n\nSecond, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household’s resources (see concept section) but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based measures show a greater concentration  of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in  the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) .\n\nThird, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes ‘large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income’. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household’s budget to health. \n\nFourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending could also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services that are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. \n\nThere are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses  a framework  which includes , __in addition to indicator 3.8.2,__ a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending [^5} [^6} [^7}\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nPopulation weighted average number of people with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income\n\n<math>\n  <mfrac>\n    <mrow>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>∑</mi>\n        <mi>𝑖</mi>\n      </msub>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>𝑚</mi>\n        <mi>𝑖</mi>\n      </msub>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>𝜔</mi>\n        <mi>𝑖</mi>\n      </msub>\n      <mn>1</mn>\n      <mo>(</mo>\n      <mfrac>\n        <mtext>health expenditure of the household i</mtext>\n        <mtext>total expenditure of the househould i</mtext>\n      </mfrac>\n      <mo>&gt;</mo>\n      <mi>𝜏</mi>\n      <mo>)</mo>\n    </mrow>\n    <mrow>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>∑</mi>\n        <mi>𝑖</mi>\n      </msub>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>𝑚</mi>\n        <mi>𝑖</mi>\n      </msub>\n      <msub>\n        <mi>𝜔</mi>\n        <mi>𝑖</mi>\n      </msub>\n    </mrow>\n  </mfrac>\n</math>\n\nwhere *𝑖* denotes a household, *1()* is the indicator function that takes on the value 1 if the bracketed expression is true, and 0 otherwise, m<sub>𝑖</sub> corresponds to the number of household members of *𝑖*, ω<sub>𝑖</sub> corresponds to the sampling weight of household *𝑖*, τ is a threshold identifying large household expenditure on health as a share of total household consumption or income (i.e. 10% and 25%).\n\nHousehold health expenditure and household expenditure or income are defined as explained in the “concept” section. For more information about the methodology please refer to Wagstaff et al (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nThe following disaggregation is possible in so far as the survey has been designed to provide representative estimates at such level:\n* Gender and age of the head of the household\n* Geographic location (rural/urban)\n* Quintiles of the household welfare measures (total household expenditure or income). See comments and limitations for the sensitivity of the disaggregation to the choice of the welfare measure.\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n\nAt the country level no imputation is attempted to produce estimates. The proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income is estimated for all years for which a nationally representative survey on household budget, household income and expenditure, socio-economic conditions or living standards is available with information on both total household expenditure or income and total household expenditure on health. When there are multiple surveys over time for the same country a preference is given to estimates produced based on the same survey. A series of tests is performed to retain the best performing series (see collection process).\n\n## Regional aggregates\n\nTo construct regional and global level estimates, when survey-based estimates are not available for the reference years of 2000, 2005 or 2010 all survey-based estimates within a 5 year window of the reference year are “lined-up” by using a combination of interpolation, extrapolation, econometric modelling and imputation based on regional medians ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO and World Bank report on tracking universal health care coverage).\n\nThe World Bank and the World Health Organization use their own regional grouping, in addition to the regional breakdown proposed for the SDG by UNSD.\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nCountry level estimates are all based on nationally representative surveys with information on both household total expenditure or income and household expenditure on health (see data sources). In most cases such data come from non-standard household surveys and  ex-post standardization processes can be designed to increase the degree of comparability across countries. For instance, regional teams from the World Bank produce standardized versions of raw datasets following common regional procedures: the ECAPOV harmonized datasets are based  on the Living Standards Measurement Study datasets – LSMS [^8] or household budget surveys (HBS) collected in the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia region; the SHIP collection results from a poverty program on harmonized household surveys in the World Bank’s African region, while the SHES collection was developed by the World Bank for the international comparison program . [^9] The Luxembourg income study (LIS) datasets results from effort to harmonize datasets from many high and middle-income countries. [^10] \n\nIn some cases the raw data is accessible to produce country level estimates. In some countries in addition to the raw data a standardized version of it is available and in other countries only the standardized version is. When multiple versions of the same survey are available the best performing in terms of a series of quality assurance tests is retained (see collection process). When a standardized version of a nationally designed survey instruments is chosen there are differences between expenditure variables generated using the raw data, and the expenditure variables generated using the harmonization procedures which might result in different estimated incidence of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of household total expenditure or income.\n\n# Data Sources\n\n## Description\n\nThe recommended data sources for the monitoring of the “Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income” are household surveys with information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national statistical offices. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures – for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare measure . [^11] The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures.\n\nWhen socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2.  For any type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for cross-country comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this happens. [^12]\n\n## Collection process\n\nWHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed following their own guidelines either directly by them or by WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access to data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken.\n\nThe World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based on the following quality checks:\n\nFor the denominator of the health expenditure ratio\n\n* Compare the logarithm of  total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey.  Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet  if available, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI) , computed as the household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the comparison is with PovcalNet [^13] and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI [^14] the survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita.\n* Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet  at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion.\n* Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.\n\nFor the numerator of the health expenditure ratio\n* Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local currency.  When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the [Global Health Expenditure Database](http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/) (GHED) [^15] and the [World Development Indicators Database](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators) (WDI) [^16] . Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).\n\nThese benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff  et al 2018.\nAt the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any given indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country consultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and information on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft estimate was produced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available for 32 of them.\n\nIn addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and the methodology simple.  Results of such collaborations are not yet included in the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality assurance process just described.\n\n# Data Availability\n\nThis indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this into account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable household survey datasets from 155 countries. Some of these surveys were excluded because they were either inaccessible, lacked key variables required for the estimation of the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income, they did not pass the quality assurance process or were not part of a consistent time series.  As of December 2017 a total of 553 datapoints from 132 countries or territories spanning the period 1984-2015 have been used to produce SDG indicator 3.8.2.\n\nData availability measured in terms of the number of countries that WHO and the World Bank have currently reviewed and retained for the estimation of the “proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income” is as follows for the most recent year:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\"></td>\n    <td colspan=\"6\">\n      Retained by WHO and the World Bank for the estimation of the \"proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income\"\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>SDG regional breakdown</td>\n    <td>Number of WHO Member States</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">2005 or earlier</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">2006-2015</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Total per SDG region</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\"></td>\n    <td>(nb of MS)</td>\n    <td>(% by region)</td>\n    <td>(nb of MS)</td>\n    <td>(% by region)</td>\n    <td>(nb of MS)</td>\n    <td>(% by region)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Northern America (M49) and Europe (M49)</td>\n    <td>44</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>13.60%</td>\n    <td>33</td>\n    <td><strong>75.00%</strong></td>\n    <td>39</td>\n    <td><strong>88.60%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Latin America and the Caribbean (MDG=M49)</td>\n    <td>33</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>21.20%</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n    <td>30.30%</td>\n    <td>17</td>\n    <td><strong>51.50%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Central Asia (M49) and Southern Asia (MDG=M49)</td>\n    <td>14</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0.00%</td>\n    <td>11</td>\n    <td><strong>78.60%</strong></td>\n    <td>11</td>\n    <td><strong>78.60%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Eastern Asia (M49) and South-eastern Asia (MDG=M49)</td>\n    <td>16</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>12.50%</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n    <td><strong>62.50%</strong></td>\n    <td>12</td>\n    <td><strong>75.00%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Western Asia (M49) and Northern Africa (M49)</td>\n    <td>23</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>17.40%</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n    <td>39.10%</td>\n    <td>13</td>\n    <td><strong>56.50%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sub-Saharan Africa (M49)</td>\n    <td>48</td>\n    <td>16</td>\n    <td>33.30%</td>\n    <td>21</td>\n    <td>43.80%</td>\n    <td>37</td>\n    <td><strong>77.10%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Australia and New Zealand (M49)</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0.00%</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td><strong>50.00%</strong></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td><strong>50.00%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Oceania (M49) excluding Australia and New Zealand (M49)</td>\n    <td>14</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>7.10%</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0.00%</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>7.10%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>194</td>\n    <td>36</td>\n    <td>18.60%</td>\n    <td>95</td>\n    <td>49.00%</td>\n    <td>131</td>\n    <td><strong>67.50%</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nOverall data availability covers at least 50% of all WHO member States in all M49 regions except for those in Oceania (7.1%).

UIS request for reclassification 2018.09.28.docx) that will allow pedagogical linking. Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of children who achieved at least minimum proficiency levels.\n\n### Table 1.

A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.\n\nTotal renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms “water resources” and “water withdrawal” are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal.\n\nInternal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation.\n\nExternal renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties.\n\nTotal freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries.

In other words, AQUASTAT frequently finds data for 2014, which is really AQUASTAT data for 2000 with the year changed (most probably when the data was harvested).\n\nDuring uploading into the Main Database, another validation process takes place, using a set of about 300 validation rules. Of these, about 100 rules are obligatory rules, which means that if the data-point doesn't obey this rule, the validation process cannot go on. For example, the cultivated area of a country cannot be larger than the total area of the country. The other set of about 200 validation rules are warning signs for the person doing the validation. For example, in general the area equipped for irrigation using surface irrigation technology is at least half of the total area equipped for irrigation. However, in some countries the localized irrigation area or the sprinkler irrigation area might be larger than the surface irrigation area. If this is the case, then a warning pops up during validation for the analyst to check whether for this country it is possible. Also during the validation process each new data-point is compared to other data already available for this variable in other years or in the same year. If it is impossible to harmonize or reconcile the different data, then one or the other data-point has to be deleted from the database.\n\nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/WhyDBisEmpty_eng.pdf\n\nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/About_us/index3.stm\n\nBeyond the usual AQUASTAT validation described above, in the compilation of the indicator countries will be encouraged and supported in setting up their own quality control system, ensuring that all data used in the computation are checked, and that consistency is kept over the years to ensure comparability and robust identification of trends.\n\nThe indicator requires data from different sectors of expertise. Internationally, they are available of different datasets from various institutions, such as FAO, UNSD and IWMI. Each of these institutions has its own established mechanism to consult and validate the data with the countries.\n\nFor the data deriving from FAOSTAT and AQUASTAT, data are collected in countries through surveys consisting of data collection and country description by means of a detailed questionnaires were the source reference and comments are associated with each value, through national resource persons. Critical analysis of information and data processing is done by FAO staff. Data are then organized in standard data tables, and feedback and approval is sought from national institutions before publication and dissemination.\n\nHowever, for the SDG process a specific mechanism will be put in place, consisting in the identification in each country, by the national government, of a national focal point and a technical team, in charge of the collection and computation of the indicator, in close consultation with FAO. This system has been successfully tested during the initial phase of the GEMI project, carried out by FAO and other seven UN agencies, coordinated by UN-Water.\n\nFor those countries that could initially have difficulties in compiling and computing the indicator, FAO will provide support and ultimately will be able to produce the indicator starting from internationally available data. However, no data will be made public without the prior approval by the relevant national authorities.","RATIONALE":"## Rationale\n\nThe purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country's water demand. It measures a country's pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress in regard to “withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity”, i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.\n\nThe indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability.","REC_USE_LIM":"## Comments and limitations\n\nWater withdrawal as a percentage of water resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management.\n\nSupplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic environments that affect water use in countries, in particular in agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator and there is no universal consensus on such threshold.\n\nTrends in water withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show meaningful variations from one year to the other.\n\nEstimation of water withdrawal by sector is the main limitation to the computation of the indicator. Few countries actually publish water use data on a regular basis by sector.\n\nRenewable water resources include all surface water and groundwater resources that are available on a yearly basis without consideration of the capacity to harvest and use this resource. Exploitable water resources, which refer to the volume of surface water or groundwater that is available with an occurrence of 90% of the time, are considerably less than renewable water resources, but no universal method exists to assess such exploitable water resources.\n\nThere is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming freshwater flows originating outside of a country's borders. Nor is there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and therefore overestimate the level of water stress.\n\nOther limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress indicator include:\n* difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data;\n* potentially large variation of sub-national data;\n* lack of account of seasonal variations in water resources;\n* lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses;\n* lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and\n* the indicator can be higher than 100 per cent when water withdrawal includes secondary freshwater (water withdrawn previously and returned to the system), non-renewable water (fossil groundwater), when annual groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment (over-abstraction) or when water withdrawal includes part or all of the water set aside for environmental water requirements.\n\nSome of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the index at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count.","REFERENCES":"## References\n\nFood and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.\n\nTotal renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms “water resources” and “water withdrawal” are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal.\n\nInternal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation.\n\nExternal renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties.\n\nTotal freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater, such as discharged wastewater and agricultural drainage water) and fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water.

The best available sources of information have been reviewed, including peer-reviewed papers, proceedings of workshops, conferences and expert meetings, global or regional databases, as well as country briefs, national reports and direct communications by country government officials and experts\n\n<http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc823e.pdf>\n\n### Cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics\n\nThis technical note, describing the issue of cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics, has two purposes: 1) to act as a general informational resource and 2) to encourage governmental agencies responsible for water usage to gather and report information disaggregated by sub-sector (keeping thermoelectric withdrawals separate from industrial and hydroelectric withdrawals), and to determine the point at which lower water withdrawal designs are more favourable, even if the required capital cost is higher.\n\n<http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc822e.pdf>\n\n### Municipal and industrial water withdrawal modelling for the years 2000 and 2005 using statistical methods\n\nThis document describes the efforts to generate models that estimate the municipal and industrial water withdrawals for the years 2000 and 2005.\n\n<http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc821e.pdf>\n\n### Disambiguation of water statistics\n\nThe nomenclature surrounding water information is often confusing and gives rise to different interpretations and thus confusion. When discussing the way in which renewable water resources are utilized, the terms water use, usage, withdrawal, consumption, abstraction, extraction, utilization, supply and demand are often used without clearly stating what is meant.\n\n<http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc816e.pdf>\n\n### Country survey on water use for agriculture and rural development\n### Questionnaire for water survey\n\nThese Guidelines and Questionnaire have been prepared for the updating of the data and country profiles in AQUASTAT.\n\n<http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls>\n\n<http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf>\n\n### International Recommendations for Water Statistics\n\nThe International Recommendations for Water Statistics (IRWS) were developed to help strengthen national information systems for water in support of design and evaluation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policies.\n\n<https://unstats.un.org/UNSD/envaccounting/irws/>\n\n### UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics – Water Section\n\n<http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm>\n\n<http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm>\n\n### UNSD ‘National Accounts Main Aggregates Database’\n\n<http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp>\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nEvery data in AQUASTAT goes through a thorough validation process:\nBefore uploading, data is compared to other variables to ensure it is logically correct (in other words: 1+2=3) and whether the reference used is not leading back to AQUASTAT itself. In other words, AQUASTAT frequently finds data for 2014, which is really AQUASTAT data for 2000 with the year changed (most probably when the data was harvested).\n\nDuring uploading into the Main Database, another validation process takes place, using a set of about 300 validation rules. Of these, about 100 rules are obligatory rules, which means that if the data-point doesn't obey this rule, the validation process cannot go on. For example, the cultivated area of a country cannot be larger than the total area of the country. The other set of about 200 validation rules are warning signs for the person doing the validation. For example, in general the area equipped for irrigation using surface irrigation technology is at least half of the total area equipped for irrigation. However, in some countries the localized irrigation area or the sprinkler irrigation area might be larger than the surface irrigation area. If this is the case, then a warning pops up during validation for the analyst to check whether for this country it is possible. Also during the validation process each new data-point is compared to other data already available for this variable in other years or in the same year. If it is impossible to harmonize or reconcile the different data, then one or the other data-point has to be deleted from the database.\n\nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/WhyDBisEmpty_eng.pdf\n\nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/About_us/index3.stm\n\nBeyond the usual AQUASTAT validation described above, in the compilation of the indicator countries will be encouraged and supported in setting up their own quality control system, ensuring that all data used in the computation are checked, and that consistency is kept over the years to ensure comparability and robust identification of trends.\n\nThe indicator requires data from different sectors of expertise. Internationally, they are available of different datasets from various institutions, such as FAO, UNSD and IWMI. Each of these institutions has its own established mechanism to consult and validate the data with the countries.\n\nFor the data deriving from FAOSTAT and AQUASTAT, data are collected in countries through surveys consisting of data collection and country description by means of a detailed questionnaires were the source reference and comments are associated with each value, through national resource persons. Critical analysis of information and data processing is done by FAO staff. Data are then organized in standard data tables, and feedback and approval is sought from national institutions before publication and dissemination.\n\nHowever, for the SDG process a specific mechanism will be put in place, consisting in the identification in each country, by the national government, of a national focal point and a technical team, in charge of the collection and computation of the indicator, in close consultation with FAO. This system has been successfully tested during the initial phase of the GEMI project, carried out by FAO and other seven UN agencies, coordinated by UN-Water.\n\nFor those countries that could initially have difficulties in compiling and computing the indicator, FAO will provide support and ultimately will be able to produce the indicator starting from internationally available data. However, no data will be made public without the prior approval by the relevant national authorities.\n\n# Data sources\n\n## Description\n\nData for this indicator are usually collected by national ministries and institutions having water-related issues in their mandate, such as ministries of water resources, agriculture, or environment. Data are mainly published within national water resources and irrigation master plans, national statistical yearbooks and other reports (such as those from projects, international surveys or results and publications from national and international research centres).\n\nThe data for the indicator are collected through questionnaires to be answered by the relevant institutions in each country. Examples of the questionnaires that can be used can be found at:\n\nAQUASTAT<br>\nwww.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls\n\nUNSD/UNEP<br>\nhttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/Questionnaires/q2013Water_English.xls\n\nOECD/Eurostat<br>\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/coded_files/OECD_ESTAT_JQ_Manual_version_2_21.pdf\n\n## Collection process\n\ni. Official counterparts at country level are the line ministry for water resources and the national statistics office\n\nii. Countries are expected to put in place a process of Quality Control (QC), Quality Assurance (QA) and data verification. The process should be carried out internally for the QC part, ensuring that all the planned steps are properly carried out at each round of data collection. The QA should be carried out by independent experts, either national or international, to assess the consistence and robustness of the data produced. Finally, where possible the resulting data should be verified by comparison with similar data from other sources.\n\niii. As the data will be collected through different questionnaires, harmonization will be needed among the eventual differences in definitions and aggregations.\n\n# Data Availability\n\n## Description\n\nCountries (2010 to present):\n\nAsia and Pacific 2<br>\nAfrica 6<br>\nLatin America and the Caribbean 16<br>\nEurope, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan 24<br>\n\nCountries (2000-2009):\n\nAsia and Pacific 42<br>\nAfrica 49<br>\nLatin America and the Caribbean 27<br>\nEurope, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan 47<br>\n\n## Time series\n\n1961-2015 (Discontinuous, depending on country)\n\n# Calendar\n\n## Data collection\n\n2016-2018\n\n## Data release\n\nNew data for the indicator are planned to be produced for most countries between 2017 and 2018.\n\n# Data providers\n\n## Description\n\nNational Statistical Offices Line ministry National consultants The institutions responsible for data collection at national level vary according to countries.

Having access to an account is an important starting point for people to access a range of financial services.\n\n## Concepts\n\nAccount at a financial institution includes respondents who report having an account at a bank or at another type of financial institution, such as a credit union, microfinance institution, cooperative, or the post office (if applicable), or having a debit card in their own name. In addition, it includes respondents who report receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products into an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; paying utility bills or school fees from an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; or receiving wages or government transfers into a card in the past 12 months. Mobile money account includes respondents who report personally using GSM Association (GSMA) Mobile Money for the Unbanked (MMU) services in the past 12 months to pay bills or to send or receive money. In addition, it includes respondents who report receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products through a mobile phone in the past 12 months.\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nWorld Bank’s Global Findex database is based on individual level surveys worldwide, conducted every three years. The first round of the survey was done in 2011, and the second in 2014. The third round will be done in 2017. The database covers about 140 countries.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nThe indicator is based on data collected through individual level surveys in each country with representative samples. Appropriate sampling weights are used in calculating country-level aggregates.\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nDisaggregation by Income; Age; Education level; Urban/rural; Gender\n\n## Treatment of missing values\n\n* **At country level**\n\n    n/a\n\n* **At regional and global levels**\n\n    n/a\n\n## Regional aggregates\n\nCountry level; the percentage of adults owning accounts is multiplied by the number of adults in the country. Then for regional values, sum across all countries in the region is taken and divided by the total adults living in the region. Similarly, for global figures, the same calculation is repeated for all countries.\n\n## Sources of discrepancies\n\nGlobal Findex is an individual level survey, measuring individual’s ownership of accounts. As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept, this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household level may measure the access to finance through another member of the household which may overestimate financial inclusion.\n\n# Data Sources\n\n## Description\n\nThe indicators in the 2014 Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database are drawn from survey data covering almost 150,000 people in more than 140 economies—representing more than 97 percent of the world’s population.

The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating to its production activities and transactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts.\n\nAn **establishment** is defined as an enterprise or part of an enterprise that is situated in a single location and in which only a single productive activity is carried out or in which the principal productive activity accounts for most of the value added. An establishment can be defined ideally as an economic unit that engages, under single ownership or control, that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or predominantly one, kind of economic activity at a single physical location. Mines, factories and workshops are examples. This ideal concept of an establishment is applicable to many of the situations encountered in industrial inquiries, particularly in manufacturing.\n\nAlthough the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility that there may be one or more secondary activities carried out in it, their magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal activity. If a secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as important, as the principal activity, then the unit is more like a local unit. It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity is treated as taking place within an establishment separate from the establishment in which the principal activity takes place.\n\nIn the case of most **small-sized businesses**, the enterprise and the establishment will be identical. Some enterprises are large and complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled.\n\nAs introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an **economic activity** is understood as referring to a process, that is to say, to the combination of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses labor, capital, goods and services to produce specific products (goods and services). In general, industrial statistics reflect the characteristics and economic activities of units engaged in a class of industrial activities that are defined in terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) (United Nations, 2008) or International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002).\n\n**Total numbers of persons employed** is defined as the total number of persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether full-time or part-time, including:\n\n* Working proprietors\n* Active business partners\n* Unpaid family workers\n* Paid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011).\n\nThe size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework.\n\nA **loan** is a financial instrument that is created when a creditor lends funds directly to a debtor and receives a nonnegotiable document as evidence of the asset. This category includes overdrafts, mortgage loans, loans to finance trade credit and advances, repurchase agreements, financial assets and liabilities created by financial leases, and claims on or liabilities to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of loans. Trade credit and advances and similar accounts payable/receivable are not loans. Loans that have become marketable in secondary markets should be reclassified under debt securities. However, if only traded occasionally, the loan is not reclassified under debt securities (IMF, 2011).\n\n**Lines of credit** and loan commitments provide a guarantee that undrawn funds will be available in the future, but no financial liability/asset exists until such funds are actually provided. Undrawn lines of credit and undisbursed loan commitments are contingent liabilities of the issuing institutions— generally, banks (IMF, 2011). A loan or line of credit refers to regulated financial institutions only.","COLL_METHOD":"## Collection process\n\nOne of the main sources of data for this indicator currently available is the Enterprise Survey conducted by the World Bank which covers the formal sector and contains data for small and medium enterprises only (with 5 or more employees).  In some countries, additional surveys, including Informal Surveys of unregistered enterprises and/or Micro Surveys for registered firms with less than five employees, are conducted and available at country level.\n\nThe Enterprise Survey is based on a representative sample of enterprises run by the private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of business environment topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and performance measures. Since 2002, the World Bank has collected these data from face-to-face interviews with top managers and business owners in over 130,000 companies in 135 economies.\n\nThe surveys have been conducted since 2002 by different units within the World Bank. Since 2005-06, most data collection efforts have been centralized within the Enterprise Analysis Unit. Data from 2006 onward is comparable across countries. The raw individual country datasets, aggregated datasets (across countries and years), panel datasets, and all relevant survey documentation are publicly available on the Enterprise Surveys web site.\n\nThe indicator uses a simple weighted percentage formula, where the weights are the sampling weights. The strata for Enterprise Surveys are firm size, business sector, and geographic region within a country. Enterprise Surveys provide indicators covering manufacturing and services activities. Proportion of “small-scale industries” with a loan or line of credit for manufacturing only can be extracted from the micro data.\nEnterprises are classified as small, medium or large based on the number of employees as follows:\n\nSize of enterprise |Number of employees\n---|---\nSmall | 5 to 19\nMedium | 20 to 99\nLarge | more than 99\n\nThe survey also defines an enterprise with female ownership as an enterprise having at least one female owner, and female-managed is measured by whether the top manager is a woman.","COMPILING_ORG":"# Data compilers\n\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)","DATA_AVAILABILITY":"# Data Availability\n\n## Description\n\nData for around 130 economies were collected.","DATA_COMP":"# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nThe proportion of “small-scale industries” with a loan or line of credit is calculated as the number of “small-scale industries” with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises:\n\n(*(the number of \"small-scale industries\" with loan or line of credit)*/*(Total number of \"small-scale industries\")*)*100","DATA_SOURCE":"# Data providers\n\nWorld Bank Enterprise Surveys","DISAGGREGATION":"# Data Sources\n\n## Description\n\nData were collected from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys as a pilot study on this indicator, however the preferable source of data are national statistical offices.","FOOTNOTE_1":"[^1]:  Some of the text on concepts and definition may be identical to Metadata submitted for Indicators 9.3.1.","FREQ_COLL":"Data frequency for each country is around 4 years.","LANGUAGE":"ENG","META_LAST_UPDATE":"April 2, 2018","META_PAGE":"9.3.2","RATIONALE":"## Rationale\n\nIndustrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. “Small-scale industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor and using local materials.

However, it has quite limited access to financial services, especially in developing countries. In order to improve the skill of workers and technology for production, small-scale industrial enterprises require financial support in the form of preferential loan, credit etc. This indicator shows how widely financial institutions are serving the “small-scale industries”.

It has implications on registration procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote “small-scale industries”. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size class for compilation purposes. In this context, UNIDO proposes that all countries compile the data by a size class of “small-scale industries” as with less than 20 persons employed. From such data, an internationally comparable data on the share of “small-scale industries” in total could be derived.","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"# Institutional information\n\n## Organization(s)\n\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)","SDG_GOAL":"Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation","SDG_INDICATOR":"Indicator 9.3.2: Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"## Time series\n\nSurveys are implemented every year in around 20 countries.","SDG_TARGET":"Target 9.3: Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets","STAT_CONC_DEF":"# Concepts and definitions  [^1]\n\n## Definition\n\nSmall-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, defined here for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class.\n\nThis indicator shows the number of “small-scale industries” with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises.","TRANS_SOURCE":"NA","full":"9.3.2\n\nApril 2, 2018\n\nENG\n\nNA\n\nGoal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nTarget 9.3: Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets\n\nIndicator 9.3.2: Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit\n\n# Institutional information\n\n## Organization(s)\n\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)\n\n# Concepts and definitions  [^1]\n\n## Definition\n\nSmall-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, defined here for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class.\n\nThis indicator shows the number of “small-scale industries” with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIndustrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. “Small-scale industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor and using local materials.

Some enterprises are large and complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled.\n\nAs introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an **economic activity** is understood as referring to a process, that is to say, to the combination of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses labor, capital, goods and services to produce specific products (goods and services). In general, industrial statistics reflect the characteristics and economic activities of units engaged in a class of industrial activities that are defined in terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) (United Nations, 2008) or International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002).\n\n**Total numbers of persons employed** is defined as the total number of persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether full-time or part-time, including:\n\n* Working proprietors\n* Active business partners\n* Unpaid family workers\n* Paid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011).\n\nThe size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework.\n\nA **loan** is a financial instrument that is created when a creditor lends funds directly to a debtor and receives a nonnegotiable document as evidence of the asset. This category includes overdrafts, mortgage loans, loans to finance trade credit and advances, repurchase agreements, financial assets and liabilities created by financial leases, and claims on or liabilities to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of loans. Trade credit and advances and similar accounts payable/receivable are not loans. Loans that have become marketable in secondary markets should be reclassified under debt securities. However, if only traded occasionally, the loan is not reclassified under debt securities (IMF, 2011).\n\n**Lines of credit** and loan commitments provide a guarantee that undrawn funds will be available in the future, but no financial liability/asset exists until such funds are actually provided. Undrawn lines of credit and undisbursed loan commitments are contingent liabilities of the issuing institutions— generally, banks (IMF, 2011). A loan or line of credit refers to regulated financial institutions only.\n\n## Comments and limitations\n\nThe main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by country indicating that data are obtained from different target populations. Data of one country are not comparable to another. \n\nThe definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal and policy framework of the country. It has implications on registration procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote “small-scale industries”. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size class for compilation purposes. In this context, UNIDO proposes that all countries compile the data by a size class of “small-scale industries” as with less than 20 persons employed. From such data, an internationally comparable data on the share of “small-scale industries” in total could be derived.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Computation Method\n\nThe proportion of “small-scale industries” with a loan or line of credit is calculated as the number of “small-scale industries” with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises:\n\n(*(the number of \"small-scale industries\" with loan or line of credit)*/*(Total number of \"small-scale industries\")*)*100\n\n# Data Sources\n\n## Description\n\nData were collected from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys as a pilot study on this indicator, however the preferable source of data are national statistical offices.\n\n## Collection process\n\nOne of the main sources of data for this indicator currently available is the Enterprise Survey conducted by the World Bank which covers the formal sector and contains data for small and medium enterprises only (with 5 or more employees).  In some countries, additional surveys, including Informal Surveys of unregistered enterprises and/or Micro Surveys for registered firms with less than five employees, are conducted and available at country level.\n\nThe Enterprise Survey is based on a representative sample of enterprises run by the private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of business environment topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and performance measures. Since 2002, the World Bank has collected these data from face-to-face interviews with top managers and business owners in over 130,000 companies in 135 economies.\n\nThe surveys have been conducted since 2002 by different units within the World Bank. Since 2005-06, most data collection efforts have been centralized within the Enterprise Analysis Unit. Data from 2006 onward is comparable across countries. The raw individual country datasets, aggregated datasets (across countries and years), panel datasets, and all relevant survey documentation are publicly available on the Enterprise Surveys web site.\n\nThe indicator uses a simple weighted percentage formula, where the weights are the sampling weights. The strata for Enterprise Surveys are firm size, business sector, and geographic region within a country. Enterprise Surveys provide indicators covering manufacturing and services activities. Proportion of “small-scale industries” with a loan or line of credit for manufacturing only can be extracted from the micro data.\nEnterprises are classified as small, medium or large based on the number of employees as follows:\n\nSize of enterprise |Number of employees\n---|---\nSmall | 5 to 19\nMedium | 20 to 99\nLarge | more than 99\n\nThe survey also defines an enterprise with female ownership as an enterprise having at least one female owner, and female-managed is measured by whether the top manager is a woman.\n\n# Data Availability\n\n## Description\n\nData for around 130 economies were collected.\n\n## Time series\n\nSurveys are implemented every year in around 20 countries.\n\nData frequency for each country is around 4 years.\n\n# Data providers\n\nWorld Bank Enterprise Surveys\n\n# Data compilers\n\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)\n\n[^1]:  Some of the text on concepts and definition may be identical to Metadata submitted for
