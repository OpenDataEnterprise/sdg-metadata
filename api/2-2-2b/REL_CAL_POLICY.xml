&lt;p&gt;The next planned release fo global/regional estimates as well as the updated country dataset is May 2017. Global and regional estimates are released annually every May starting in 2017. The country level dataset is updated and released more often than the global/regional estimates. Although a set schedule has not yet been established, there have been at least two annual updates (one coinciding with the annual release of the regional/global estimates and at least one other update at another time of the year).&lt;/p&gt;
