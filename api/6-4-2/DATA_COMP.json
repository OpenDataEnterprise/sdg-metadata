All variables are expressed in km3/year (109 m3/year).\n\n$$Stress (\\%) = TWW \\div (TRWR - Env.) \\times 100$$\n\nIt is proposed to classify the level of water stress in three main categories (levels): low, high and very high. The thresholds for the indicator could be country specific, to reflect differences in climate and national water management objectives. Alternatively, uniform thresholds could be proposed using existing literature and taking into account environmental water requirements.","ru":""}}
