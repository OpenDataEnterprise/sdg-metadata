One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. \n\nNote that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage."}
