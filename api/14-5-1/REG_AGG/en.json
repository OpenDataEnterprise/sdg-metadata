{"status":"success","message":"The REG_AGG field for indicator 14-5-1, translated into en","data":"## Regional aggregates\n\nUNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator.\n\nImportant Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way.\n\nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability (holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of the target species, for at least one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at which species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species).\n\nThe Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide. Hence, they represent important areas to consider designating as formal protected areas."}
