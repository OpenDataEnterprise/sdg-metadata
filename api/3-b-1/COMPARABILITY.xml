&lt;p&gt;Countries often relay on administrative coverage data, while WHO and UNICEF review and assess data from different sources including administrative systems and surveys. Differences between country produced and international estimates are mainly due to differences between coverage estimates from administrative system and survey results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case the vaccine is not included in national immunization schedule the coverage from private sector will not be reflected. &lt;/p&gt;
