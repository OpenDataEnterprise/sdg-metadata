<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>Coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged population).</p>
<p>The indicator is an index reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, which is computed as the geometric mean of 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage.</p>
<h2>Concepts:</h2>
<p>The index of health service coverage is computed as the geometric means of 14 tracer indicators. The 14 indicators are listed below and detailed metadata for each of the components are given online (<a href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/UHC_Tracer_Indicators_Metadata.pdf">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/UHC_Tracer_Indicators_Metadata.pdf</a>) and Annex 1. The tracer indicators are as follows, organized by four broad categories of service coverage:</p>
<p><strong><em><ins class="mod">I. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health</em></strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Family planning</strong>: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15&#x2212;49 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods </p>
<p>2. <strong>Pregnancy and delivery care</strong>: Percentage of women aged 15-49 years with a live birth in a given time period who received antenatal care four or more times</p>
<p>3. <strong>Child immunization</strong>: Percentage of infants receiving three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccine</p>
<p>4. <strong>Child treatment</strong>: Percentage of children under 5 years of age with suspected pneumonia (cough and difficult breathing NOT due to a problem in the chest and a blocked nose) in the two weeks preceding the survey taken to an appropriate health facility or provider</p>
<p><strong><em><ins class="mod">II. Infectious diseases</em></strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>Tuberculosis</strong>: Percentage of incident TB cases that are detected and successfully treated</p>
<p>6. <strong>HIV/AIDS</strong>: Percentage of people living with HIV currently receiving antiretroviral therapy</p>
<p>7. <strong>Malaria</strong>: Percentage of population in malaria-endemic areas who slept under an insecticide-treated net the previous night [only for countries with high malaria burden]</p>
<p>8. <strong>Water and sanitation</strong>: Percentage of households using at least basic sanitation facilities</p>
<p><strong><em><ins class="mod">III. Noncommunicable diseases</em></strong></p>
<p>9. <strong>Hypertension</strong>: Age-standardized prevalence of non-raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) among adults aged 18 years and older</p>
<p>10. <strong>Diabetes</strong>: Age-standardized mean fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) for adults aged 18 years and older</p>
<p>11. <strong>Tobacco</strong>: Age-standardized prevalence of adults &gt;=15 years not smoking tobacco in last 30 days (SDG indicator 3.a.1, metadata available <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-0a-01.pdf">here</a>)</p>
<p><strong><em><ins class="mod">IV. Service capacity and access</em></strong></p>
<p>12. <strong>Hospital access</strong>: Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per 10,000 population</p>
<p>13. <strong>Health workforce</strong>: Health professionals (physicians, psychiatrists, and surgeons) per capita, relative to maximum thresholds for each cadre (partial overlap with SDG indicator 3.c.1, see metadata <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-0C-01.pdf">here</a>)</p>
<p>14. <strong>Health security</strong>: International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is the average percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained (SDG indicator 3.d.1, see metadata <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-0D-01.pdf">here</a>)</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em><ins class="mod">At country level:</ins></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The starting point for computing the index is to assemble existing information for each tracer indicator. In many cases, this involves using country time series that have been produced or collated by UN agencies in consultation with country governments (e.g., immunization coverage, access to sanitation, HIV treatment coverage, etc). Some of these published time series involve mathematical modelling to reconcile multiple data sources or impute missing values, and these details are summarized in Annex 1. </p>
<p>After assembling these inputs, there are still missing values for some country-years for some indicators. Calculating the UHC service coverage index requires values for each tracer indicator for a country, so some imputation is necessary to fill these data gaps. The current approach involves a simple imputation algorithm. For each indicator:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>If a country has missing values between two years with values, linear interpolation is used to fill missing values for the intervening years</li>
      <li>If a country has historical years with values, but no current value, constant extrapolation is used to fill missing values to the current year</li>
      <li>If a country has no values, a value is imputed. For pneumonia care-seeking and density of surgeons, a regression is fit to impute missing values (see Annex 1 for details). For all other indicators, a regional median is calculated to impute missing values. Regions are based on World Bank geographic regions, with a separate grouping of traditional high-income countries<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Given the timing and distribution of various health surveys and other data collection mechanisms, countries do not collect and report on all 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage on an annual basis. In addition, monitoring at country level is most suitably done at broader time intervals, e.g., every 5 years, to allow for new data collection across indicators. Therefore, the extent to which imputation has been used to fill missing information should be communicated along with the index value. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em><ins class="mod">At regional and global levels:</ins></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any needed imputation is done at country level. These country values can then be used to compute regional and global ones.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-1">1</sup><p> Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay <a href="#footnote-ref-1">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div></div>
