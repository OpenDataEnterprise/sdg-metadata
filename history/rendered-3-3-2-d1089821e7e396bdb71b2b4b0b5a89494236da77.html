<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>The tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population as defined as the estimated number of new and relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including cases in people living with HIV) arising in a given year, expressed as a rate per 100 000 population.</p>
<h2>Concepts:</h2>
<p>Direct measurement requires high-quality surveillance systems in which underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that under-diagnosis is also negligible; otherwise indirect estimates are based on notification data and estimates of levels of underreporting and under-diagnosis.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b. Data collection method (COLL_METHOD)</div></div></div><p><h2><strong>Collection process<ins class="mod"></ins></strong>:</p></h2>
<p>National TB Programmes report every year between March and June their annual TB data to WHO using a standardized online data reporting system maintained at WHO. The system includes real-time checks for data consistency. Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and communicated with countries. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated separately during the year. All estimates are communicated in August-September and revisions are done based on feedback. The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex groups.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.c.

<p>Following two years of consultations, a new post-2015 global tuberculosis strategy was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2014. Known as the End TB Strategy, it covers the period 2016-2035. The overall goal is to &#x201C;End the global tuberculosis epidemic&#x201D;, and correspondingly ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs. </p>
<p>The tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for measuring reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this indicator was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in 2014, notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if there is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or over-diagnosis of cases.</p></div>
