<ul>
  <li><strong><em><ins class="mod">At country level<ins class="diffins">:</ins></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For countries with less than two surveys completed in different years since 1990, no estimate is calculated, since no trend can be determined. For countries with data from two or more surveys, data gaps, if any, are filled as described in the Computation Method.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em><ins class="mod">At regional and global levels<ins class="diffins">:</ins></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Countries where no estimate can be calculated are included in regional and global averages by assuming their prevalence rates for men and women are equal to the average rates for men and women seen in the UN sub-region<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> in which they are located. Where fewer than 50% of a UN sub-region&#x2019;s population was surveyed, UN sub-regions are grouped with neighbouring sub-regions until at least 50% of the grouped population has contributed data to the region&#x2019;s average rates.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-1">1</sup><p> For a listing of countries by UN region, please refer to pages ix to xiii of World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs in 2015 at https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Volume-I_Comprehensive-Tables.pdf (accessed May 25, 2017). For the purposes of smoking analysis, the following adjustments were made: (i) Eastern Africa sub-region was divided into two regions: Eastern Africa Islands and Remainder of Eastern Africa; (ii) Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were classified with Eastern Europe, (iii); Cyprus, Israel and Turkey were classified with Southern Europe, and (iv) Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia sub-regions were combined into one sub-region. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div></div>
