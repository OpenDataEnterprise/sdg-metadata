<h2><strong><strong>Definition:</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Proportion of firms asked for a gift or informal payment when meeting with tax officials. </p>
<p>In every Enterprise Survey (<a href="file:///C:\Users\jenpa\AppData\Local\Temp\Temp1_Tier%201-Pilot%20Refresh.zip\Tier%201-Pilot%20Refresh\www.enterprisesurveys.org">www.enterprisesurveys.org</a>), there is a standard question which asks the survey respondent if they were inspected by or required to meet with tax officials. If the respondent indicates &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during these inspections/meetings. The response options include &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, &#x201C;no&#x201D;, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;, and &#x201C;refuse&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment as well as firm&#x2019;s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Concepts:</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or services establishments. These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website: <a href="file:///C:\Users\jenpa\AppData\Local\Temp\Temp1_Tier%201-Pilot%20Refresh.zip\Tier%201-Pilot%20Refresh\www.enterprisesurveys.org\methodology">www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology</a></p>
<p>A gift or an informal payment is considered a &#x2018;bribe&#x2019;.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><h2><strong><strong>Treatment of missing values:</strong></strong></h2>
<h5><ul><ins class="diffmod">
  </ins><li><strong><em><ins class="mod">At country level:</ins></em></strong></h5></li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></ul>
<p>The indicator value is not imputed for countries which do not have an Enterprise Survey.</p>

</ins></ul>
<p>Regional and global aggregates of the indicator are derived from completed surveys. A single point estimate is created for each country and a global/regional aggregate takes a simple average of every country&#x2019;s point estimate (when there is available data for that country). For example the East Asia Pacific average (point estimate) for the indicator does not include Japan since there is no Enterprise Survey for Japan.</p></div>
