"## Concepts\r\n"
"\r\n"
"**International remittance transfer.** A cross-border person-to-person "
"payment of relatively low value. The transfers are typically recurrent "
"payments by migrant workers (who send money to their families in their home "
"country every month). In the report, the term “remittance transfer” is used "
"for simplicity (ie it is assumed the transfer is international).\r\n"
"\r\n"
"**Remittance service.** A service that enables end users to send and/or "
"receive remittance transfers.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"**Remittance service provider (RSP).** An entity, operating as a business, "
"that provides a remittance service for a price to end users, either "
"directly or through agents. These include both banks and money transfer "
"operators, as defined below.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"**Money transfer operator (MTO).** A non-deposit taking payment service "
"provider where the service involves payment per transfer (or possibly "
"payment for a set or series of transfers) by the sender to the payment "
"service provider (for example, by cash or bank transfer) – i.e. as opposed "
"to a situation where the payment service provider debits an account held by "
"the sender at the payment service provider. MTOs may include both "
"traditional players focusing on delivering funds in cash and innovative "
"players which may adopt a variety of different business models for the "
"delivery of the transactions.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"**Price.** The total cost to the end users of sending a remittance transfer "
"(including the fees charged to the sender and the margin by which the "
"exchange rate charged to the end users is above the current interbank "
"exchange rate)."

"# Methodology\r\n"
"\r\n"
"## Computation Method\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Data is collected through a mystery shopping exercise of remittance service "
"providers (RSPs). A sample of RSPs including at least 80% of the market "
"share in each corridor are included in the mystery shopping exercise. The "
"average cost is calculated as the simple average of total costs (including "
"both fee and exchange rate margin) quoted by each RSP operating in a "
"corridor.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"In 2016, introduced the Smart Remitter Target (SmarRT) to monitor "
"remittance transactions at a more granular level. It aims to reflect the "
"cost that a savvy consumer with access to sufficiently complete information "
"would pay to transfer remittances in each corridor. SmaRT is calculated as "
"the simple average as the three cheapest services for sending the "
"equivalent of $200 in each corridor and is expressed in terms of the "
"percentage of the total amount sent. In addition to transparency, services "
"must meet additional criteria to be included in SmaRT, including "
"transaction speed (5 days or less) and accessibility (determined by "
"geographic proximity of branches for services that require physical "
"presence, or access to any technology or device necessary to use the "
"service, such as a bank account, mobile phone or the internet.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"For additional information on the methodology of SmaRT, please see: "
"**https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/smart_"
"methodology.pdf **\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Target 10.c.1 includes two components, which require two separate "
"calculations:\r\n"
"1. Global average of remittance costs to be reduced to less than 3 percent: "
"this is calculated as the simple average of the total cost for all services "
"included in the RPW database\r\n"
"2. Enabling remittance senders in all corridors to send money to their "
"receivers at a cost of 5 percent or less: this is calculated as the average "
"cost of the three cheapest available services in each corridor which meet a "
"defined set of minimum requirements, as described in the World Bank SmaRT "
"methodology. The target is that the SmaRT average for all corridors should "
"be 5 percent or lower."

"## Disaggregation\n"
"\n"
"RPW tracks the cost of remittances by the type of remittance service "
"providers: commercial banks, money transfer operators, post offices, mobile "
"money providers (more provider types may be added as market evolves). In "
"addition, disaggregation is also possible by the instrument used to fund "
"the transaction: including but not limited to cash, bank account, "
"debit/credit card, mobile money etc.; and by the instrument used to "
"disburse the funds: including but not limited to cash, bank account, mobile "

"## Quality assurance\n"
"\n"
"Data are collected by researchers through mystery shopping, and "

"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"Data for these indicators have been collected by the World Bank through the "
"Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) database since 2008 for the purpose of "
"monitoring the G8 / G20 target on reducing remittance prices. Also known as "
"the “5x5 objective”, this goal was adopted by the G8 in 2009, and it refers "
"to reduction of the global average total cost of migrant remittances by 5 "
"percentage points in 5 years. To achieve this objective, the governments in "
"both sending and receiving countries should consider implementing reforms "
"based upon the General Principles for International Remittances Services by "
"the World Bank/Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (January 2007). "
"This internationally agreed framework has proven effective in helping "
"reduce the cost of remittances and guiding actions to enhance the "
"efficiency of international remittances. The World Bank’s RPW database is "
"the only global database that monitors remittance prices across all regions "
"of the world. RPW was launched by the World Bank in September 2008, and is "
"a key tool in monitoring the evolution of costs to the remitters and the "
"beneficiaries from sending and receiving money in major country corridors."

"## Definition\n"
"\n"
"The target includes two components. The first component is that transaction "
"costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This "
"transaction cost should be intended as **“Global average total cost of "
"sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % "
"of amount sent”**. This indicator is readily available and published on a "
"quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide "
"database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 "
"receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where "
"cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should "
"be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an "
"average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should "
"suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a "
"defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach "
"etc.), for which the average is 5% or less."
