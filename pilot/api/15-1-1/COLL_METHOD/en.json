{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 15-1-1, translated into en","data":"## Collection process\n\nAll data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report following a standard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been used to estimate the forest area for different points in time. \n\nOfficially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the country reports for the assessment. Some prepare more than one report as they also report on dependent territories. For the remaining countries and territories where no information is provided, a report is prepared by FAO using existing information and a literature search.\n\nOnce received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions and methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and FAO staff by e-mail and regional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process. All country reports (including those prepared by FAO) are sent to the respective Head of Forestry for validation before finalization. The data are then aggregated at sub-regional, regional and global levels by the FRA team at FAO."}
