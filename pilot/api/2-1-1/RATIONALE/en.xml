	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 2-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>## Rationale

The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit Target and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since 1999. It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the householdsâ€™ ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time. 

The parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable estimates for relatively large population groups. As it reflects a severe condition of lack of food, it is fully consistent with the spirit of a Goal that aims at reducing hunger.</data>
