	<data>## Regional aggregates 

Regional and global aggregates of the PoU are computed as: 

\\[PoU_{REG} = (_i PoU_i Ã— N_i) / (_i N_i)\\]

where PoU_i are the values of PoU estimated for all countries in the regions for which available data allow to compute a reliable estimate, and N_i the corresponding population size.</data>
