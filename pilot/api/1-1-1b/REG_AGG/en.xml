	<data>## Regional aggregates

The ILO produces global and regional estimates of employment by economic class (and thus, of working poverty rates) using the ILO’s Employment by Class (EbyC) model. These estimates are part of the ILO Estimates and Projections series, analysed in the ILO&apos;s World Employment and Social Outlook reports. For more information, on the model used to derive these estimates, refer to the ILO paper “Employment and economic class in the developing world” (Kapsos and Bourmpoula, 2013), available at &lt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_216451.pdf&gt;.</data>
