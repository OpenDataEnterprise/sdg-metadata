	<data>[^8]: The original EGM’s advice considered a range of less than three to four people per habitable room. When this indicator got operationalized during the MDG 7 Target 7.D’s tracking, overcrowding was fixed at a maximum of three people per habitable room (‘minimum of four square meters,’ &lt;http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx&gt;).</data>
