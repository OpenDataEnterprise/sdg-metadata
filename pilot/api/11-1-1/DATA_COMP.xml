## Computation method
The indicator considers two components to be computed as follows:

a) Slum/Informal Settlements households (SISH):  
\\[=100 \times [{\text{Number of people living in SISH households} \over \text{City population}}]\\]

 b) Inadequate housing households (IHH):  
\\[=100 \times [{\text{Number of people living in IHH} \over \text{City population}}]\\]

The unit of measurements for all these indicators will be %. Currently, the data for this indicator is already being reported in nearly all developing countries on what refers to slums and informal settlements, and in some countries for what refers to expenditure on housing. The SDG indicator 11.1.1 will therefore contribute to report on a broader spectrum of inadequate housing conditions affecting households in all countries.
