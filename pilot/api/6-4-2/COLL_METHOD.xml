1. Official counterparts at country level are the line ministry for water resources and the national statistics office
2. Countries are expected to put in place a process of Quality Control (QC), Quality Assurance (QA) and data verification. The process should be carried out internally for the QC part, ensuring that all the planned steps are properly carried out at each round of data collection. The QA should be carried out by independent experts, either national or international, to assess the consistence and robustness of the data produced. Finally, where possible the resulting data should be verified by comparison with similar data from other sources.
3. As the data will be collected through different questionnaires, harmonization will be needed among the eventual differences in definitions and aggregations.
