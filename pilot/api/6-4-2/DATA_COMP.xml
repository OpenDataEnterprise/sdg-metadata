## Computation method
Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (\\(TWW\\)) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (\\(TRWR\\)) and the environmental water requirements (\\(Env.\\)), multiplied by 100. All variables are expressed in km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year (109 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year).

\\[Stress (\%) = TWW \div (TRWR - Env.) \times 100\\]

It is proposed to classify the level of water stress in three main categories (levels): low, high and very high. The thresholds for the indicator could be country specific, to reflect differences in climate and national water management objectives. Alternatively, uniform thresholds could be proposed using existing literature and taking into account environmental water requirements.
