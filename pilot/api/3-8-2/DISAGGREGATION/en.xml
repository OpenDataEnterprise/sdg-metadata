	<data>## Disaggregation

The following disaggregation is possible in so far as the survey has been designed to provide representative estimates at such level:
* Gender and age of the head of the household
* Geographic location (rural/urban)
* Quintiles of the household welfare measures (total household expenditure or income). See comments and limitations for the sensitivity of the disaggregation to the choice of the welfare measure.</data>
