  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>Tourism Direct GDP (TDGDP) is defined as the sum of the part of gross value
  added (at basic prices) generated by all industries in response to internal
  tourism consumption plus the amount of net taxes on products and imports
  included within the value of this expenditure at purchasers&#x2019; prices.
  The indicator relies on the Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended
  Methodological Framework 2008, an international standard adopted by the UN
  Statistical Commission and elaborated by UNWTO, OECD and EUROSTAT. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) is the part of gross value added
  generated by tourism industries and other industries of the economy that
  directly serve visitors in response to internal tourism consumption. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP): It is the main measure of national output,
  representing the total value of all final goods and services within the System
  of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary produced in a particular
  economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services within the SNA
  production boundary produced within a country&#x2019;s borders in a given
  year). According to the SNA, &#x201C;GDP is the sum of gross value added of
  all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on
  products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of
  output &#x2026; GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and
  services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at
  purchasers&#x2019; prices, less the value of imports of goods and services GDP
  is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer
  units.&#x201D; </p>

SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The indicator is sourced from countries&#x2019; Tourism Satellite Account,
  which is a satellite account to the National Accounts. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>UNWTO sends a pre-filled excel questionnaire (including data from official
  publications and official web-sites) to countries to collect the latest data
  on TDGDP. In order to lighten the reporting burden of countries, UNWTO
  receives data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
  (OECD) on behalf of its constituents<sup>1</sup>. This exercise is being
  carried out on a yearly basis. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The questionnaire is sent out to countries in August and data collection is
  closed in January of the following year.</p>

  <p>Target 8.9 has several dimensions; this caters to the dimension:
  <em>tourism</em>; <em>promote </em>[...] <em>tourism</em>. The value of the
  economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative)
  increases or decreases in it, could indicate the degree to which tourism is
  being successfully promoted. </p>

  <p>This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at national level and the
  level of sub-national regions as it gives a more inclusive measure of the
  economic contribution of tourism (i.e. including all forms of tourism
  according to International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008), which
  can be compared to GDP contributions of other economic activities. The
  indicator has been found especially useful in promoting and mainstreaming
  tourism in policy agendas at all levels. The indicator can also be compared
  across countries. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Given that a growing number of countries produce Tourism Satellite Account
  (TSA), data on the suggested indicators could become available in many more
  countries in the near future. </p>

  <p>The data demands &#x2013; among others - detailed input-output or supply
  and use tables for setting up a TSA; this means that it is often not possible
  to have current data or frequent updating of the TSA. Therefore, some
  countries produce estimates of TSA aggregates, in between reference years, to
  have more current data and to produce a time series. </p>

  <p>TDGDP/GDP tends to do not show large variations from one year to the next
  and variations may stem from the numerator and/or denominator. This could
  warrant considering the indicator in different forms: absolute value, % change
  in constant price, and TDGDP per visitor or per employed person. </p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p> Every year historical data is requested. If there are differences in the
  newly reported data for the country with respect to the data available
  previously, countries are consulted. Similarly, if other inconsistencies are
  found, there is ongoing follow up with countries. Since Table 6 of TSA is
  necessary for the compilation of TDGDP, the data reported by countries is
  cross-validated with the availability of this table through the data reported
  for SDG indicator 12.b.1, which also falls under the responsibility of
  UNWTO.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: ''
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level </li>
  </ul>

  <p>UNWTO will use the travel credits and passenger transport credits according
  to the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2007/pdf/bpm6.pdf"
  target="_blank"><u>Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
  Manual sixth edition</u></a> (BPM6) related to GDP as a proxy of the TDGDP.
  The mode of calculation of the proxy is: </p>

  <p>(travel credits + passenger transport credits) / (Gross Domestic Product) x
  100. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>This indicator represents a basic evaluation of tourism&#x2019;s economic
  contribution to the national economy, which is largely available for most
  countries, internationally comparable, and comparable to other economic
  indicators. Indeed, this indicator is regularly produced by UNWTO and
  disseminated in its worldwide database. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Aggregates are computed for the SDG regions and at the global level. </p>

  <p>For every year, estimates for countries are computed as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>For countries without any reported data</em><br>A multivariate linear regression model based on the number of hotel rooms in the country and the inbound tourism expenditure (both available via UNWTO&#xB4;s statistical database) as explanatory variables is used.</li>
    <li><em>For countries with reported data for years other than the year of reference</em><br>A simple linear model based on inbound tourism expenditure as explanatory variable is used to estimate the nominal percent change in TDGDP. These values are used to retro- and extrapolate the values reported by the country, using these as benchmark. For reference years between years with reported data, a linear trend between reported years is used. </li>
    <li><em>Special cases<br></em>Some data reported by countries that do not correspond to Tourism Direct GDP or GVA and are therefore not published, can still be used in the calculation of aggregates. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>For each year, countries without reported data for which the methodology
  yields negative estimates or for which no data to feed the linear models are
  available are discarded. Regional (and global) aggregates are then obtained by
  computing weighted averages of TDGDP, using total GDP as the weight, for
  countries within the region of interest for which data or estimates are
  available. </p>

  <p>GDP coverage for each aggregate is obtained by calculating the percentage
  of total regional GDP that is represented by countries for which data is
  reported or for which an estimate is available. If this coverage is relatively
  low (below 60 percent), estimates are published with a cautionary footnote.

  <p> </p>

  <p>UNWTO, in collaboration with UNSD, is currently developing a Compilation
  Guide for the TSA. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For the purposes of SDG reporting, UNWTO has developed an experimental
  approach that might be used by countries with limited data to compile
  estimates of TDGDP using the conceptual framing of the TSA and the most
  commonly available data but not requiring the full compilation of TSA. In this
  regard, the approach is intended to provide a starting point for countries
  with limited data that can then move towards the compilation of TSA and the
  more complete measurement of TDGDP. For more information, see <a
  href="http://cf.cdn.unwto.org/sites/all/files/pdf/mst_research_paper_measuring_tdgdp.pdf"

COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>More than 70 countries have some kind of TSA exercise and data available on
  this indicator, as shown in an international TSA data compilation exercise
  UNWTO realized in 2010 (see &#x201C;<a
  href="http://statistics.unwto.org/sites/all/files/pdf/tsa_data.pdf"
  target="_blank"><u>TSA data around the world</u></a>&#x201D;). </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Annual data from 2008 onwards are available. </p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>TDGDP is derived from the productive activities that cater directly to
  tourism and so it could be possible to disaggregate by tourism industries
  (e.g. accommodation for visitors, the different kinds of passenger
  transportation, etc.). </p>

  <p>Sub-national disaggregation/estimates of Tourism Direct GDP are possible
  and there are a number of subnational regions that have information on this.
  However, there is no consensus on a methodology for doing this in a
  standardized way, compromising international comparability. In any case, it
  seems that collection of data would be warranted only for those regions that
  consider tourism a significant (economic) activity. </p>
