  <p>Definitions:</p>

  <p>Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as
  alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar
  year in litres of pure alcohol </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is defined as the total (sum of
  recorded APC three-year average and unrecorded APC as a proportion of total)
  amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year, in
  litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption. Recorded alcohol
  consumption refers to official statistics at country level (production,
  import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol
  consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual
  system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol
  (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not
  intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border
  shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). Tourist consumption
  takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting
  other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption of outbound
  tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists, negative
  numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data
  are provided by IHME. </p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Recorded alcohol per capita (15+) consumption of pure alcohol is calculated
  as the sum of beverage-specific alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer,
  wine, spirits, other) from different sources. The first priority in the
  decision tree is given to government national statistics; second are
  country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on
  interviews or fieldwork (GlobalData (formerly Canadean), International Wine
  and Spirit Research (IWSR), Wine Institute; historically World Drink Trends)
  or data from the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV); third is
  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&apos; statistical
  database (FAOSTAT), and fourth is data from alcohol industry statistics in the
  public domain based on desk review. For countries, where the data source is
  FAOSTAT the unrecorded consumption may be included in the recorded
  consumption. As from the introduction of the &quot;Other&quot;
  beverage-specific category, beer includes malt beers, wine includes wine made
  from grapes, spirits include all distilled beverages, and other includes one
  or several other alcoholic beverages, such as fermented beverages made from
  sorghum, maize, millet, rice, or cider, fruit wine, fortified wine, etc. For
  unrecorded APC, the first priority in the decision tree is given to nationally
  representative empirical data; these are often general population surveys in
  countries where alcohol is legal. Second are specific other empirical
  investigations, and third is expert opinion supported by periodic survey of
  experts at country level (50 countries with significant estimates of
  unrecorded alcohol consumption) using modified Delphi-technique. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For recorded APC, in order to make the conversion into litres of pure
  alcohol, the alcohol content (% alcohol by volume) is considered to be as
  follows: Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%,
  vermouth 16%), Spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and Other
  (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified wine 17% and 18%;
  fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%). Survey
  questions on consumption of unrecorded alcohol are converted into estimates
  per year of unrecorded APC. In some countries, unrecorded is estimated based
  on confiscated alcohol confiscated by customs or police. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age and older) in a
  country were based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the
  average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people
  drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita
  consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol
  consumption also accounted for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol
  while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of
  their country (for all people 15 years and older) and the amount of alcohol
  consumed in their country of origin). These estimations assumed the following:
  (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as
  they do in their home countries, and (2) that global tourist consumption is
  equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net negative or
  positive). </p>

  <p>The Global Survey on Alcohol and Health is conducted periodically (latest
  one in 2016) in collaboration with all six WHO regional offices. National
  counterparts or focal points in all WHO Member States are officially nominated
  by the respective ministries of health. They are provided with the online
  survey data collection tool for completion. Where this is not feasible, a hard
  copy of the tool is forwarded directly to those who requested it. The survey
  submissions are checked and whenever information is incomplete or in need of
  clarification, the questionnaire is returned to the focal point or national
  counterpart in the country concerned for revision. Amendments to the survey
  responses are resubmitted by e-mail or electronically. Data submitted from
  countries is triangulated with data from key industry-supported data providers
  at annual meetings organized by WHO with an objective to identify
  discrepancies and solutions. Estimates for key indicators are compiled into
  country profiles which are sent to the focal point or national counterpart in
  the country for validation and endorsement. </p>

  <p>The indicator is feasible and suitable for monitoring purposes as evidenced
  by availability of data from 190 countries and inclusion of this indicator in
  global, regional and national monitoring frameworks. This is the key indicator
  for alcohol exposure in populations. The data available (based on production,
  import, export, and sales or taxation) do not enable the disaggregation of
  alcohol per capita consumption (APC) by sex or age; to this end, other data
  sources, such as survey data, are needed. The estimation of unrecorded APC
  remains a challenge, and triangulation of data from different sources as well
  as Delphi-techniques are used for increasing validity of estimates. In recent
  time the number of research activities focused on improvement of the estimates
  of unrecorded alcohol consumption as well as their geographical coverage have
  increased substantially. As a result, it leads to a more accurate assessment
  of the total amount of alcohol consumed per person per year in a given
  country. </p>
