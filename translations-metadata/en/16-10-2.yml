  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory
  and/or policy guarantees for public access to information</p>

  <p>The focus of this indicator is thus on the status of adoption and
  implementation of constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for
  public access to information. The definition relates directly to
  &#x201C;public access to information&#x201D;, which is wider than, but is also
  very much based upon, the established fundamental freedoms of expression and
  association. Conversely, these freedoms also both impact on the environment
  for public access to information. </p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>Conceptually, &#x2018;public access to information&#x2019; refers to
  &#x201C;the presence of a robust system through which information is made
  available to citizens and others.&#x201D; Such a system represents a
  combination of intellectual, physical, and social elements that affect the
  availability of information to individuals. In other words, in discussing the
  issue of public access to information, it is important to recognize that any
  measurement of its practical outworking needs to take into account how
  individuals perceive the quality of information in the public domain, the
  nature of the communicative infrastructure in place to facilitate access, and
  how that information is ultimately utilized by individuals as members of a
  particular polity. </p>

  <p>In general, then, these are the issues that go into legislation and policy
  on public access. More specifically, such legislation and policy take the form
  of Freedom of Information laws (FOI laws) which are aimed at allowing access
  by the general public to data held by national governments and, increasingly,
  by private companies whose work intersect with government operations. </p>

  <p>The emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to
  increasing dissatisfaction with the secrecy surrounding government policy
  development and decision making. They establish a &quot;right-to-know&quot;
  legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information,
  to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions.</p>

  <p>Such a formulation has a basis in international agreements. For example,
  the right to freedom of expression, which is not only recognized as a basic
  human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), is also
  upheld in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the
  European Convention on Human Rights (1950), the American Convention on Human
  Rights (1969) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x2019; Rights
  (1981), thus lending itself to universal political recognition and
  application. More specifically, in the European context, reference may be made
  to the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents, adopted
  on 18 June 2009. In the Americas, the Organization of American States&#x2019;
  Inter-American Juridical Committee developed a set of Principles on the Right
  of Access to Information in 2008.</p>

  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>UNESCO uses a triangulated method to compare data for global monitoring,
  which includes (I) databases maintained by other international agencies; (2)
  own international surveys carried out in countries by independent entities and
  (3) modelled and estimated data, based on other data sources. More
  specifically, UNESCO analyses data inputs from a variety of sources to produce
  a consensus list of countries with freedom of information laws or equivalent.
  Among those organizations and experts that make available their data are:
  Freedominfo.org, Fringe Special by Robert Vleugels, Open Society Justice
  Initiative, Right to Information Rating, by Access Info Europe and the Centre
  for Law and Democracy, ARTICLE 19. Others include international agencies and
  UN bodies, such as: The World Bank, The Office of the High Commissioner for
  Human Rights, The UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the
  Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression.</p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>As suggested by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and
  UNESCO in earlier presentations to the UN Technical Support Team (UN TST),
  this is a relevant and measurable indicator. </p>

  <p>It also responds to the growing number of UN member states that have
  already adopted legal guarantees, and many others that are currently
  considering relevant legislation or regulation in the field.</p>

  <p>The rationale for assessing the implementation dimension is to assess the
  relevance of legal steps to practical information accessibility. It is not a
  composite indicator, but a logical linkage of laws and policies to practical
  impact that is relevant to SDG concerns.</p>

  <p>For this indicator, the operative words are &#x201C;adoption&#x201D; and
  &#x201C;implementation&#x201D;. As such, it establishes: (a) whether a country
  (or at the global level, the number of countries) has constitutional,
  statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information; (b) the
  extent to which such national guarantees reflect &#x2018;international
  agreements&#x2019; (e.g. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, etc.); and (c)
  the implementation mechanisms in place for such guarantees, including the
  following variables:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Government efforts to publicly promote the right to information.</li>
    <li>Citizens&#x2019; awareness of their legal right to information and their ability to utilize it effectively.</li>
    <li>The capacity of public bodies to provide information upon request by the public. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This indicator thus collates data from multiple sources, including National
  Human Rights Institutions, national and international non-governmental
  organizations, academic institutions, and national media regulatory
  authorities, among others. Such information will be gathered, processed and
  checked by international organizations - UNESCO and World Bank.</p>

  <p>UNESCO collects some aspects of this data using the Media Development
  Indicators, in addition to the biennial World Trends in Freedom of Expression
  and Media Development report. </p>

  <p>Data on the existence of freedom of information laws are available for at
  least 195 countries.</p>

  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>This indicator does not assess the totality of &#x201C;public access to
  information&#x201D; component of the full Target of 16.10. Nevertheless, it
  focusses on a key determinant of the wider information environment.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The method of computation is both quantitative and qualitative, with data
  generated from a global review of existing surveys (e.g. UNESCO&apos;s World
  Trends in Freedom of Expression &amp; Media Development reports, etc.),
  administrative records, expert assessments (e.g. World Justice Open Government
  Index), etc. More specifically, the following key variables will be assessed:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Does a country have constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information?</li>
    <li>Do those constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees reflect known international agreements (e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.)?</li>
    <li>What implementation mechanisms are in place to ensure that such guarantees work optimally?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To address these questions, the following will serve as performance
  sub-indicators:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>National law or constitutional guarantee on the right to information</li>
    <li>Country has signed and ratified relevant treaty obligations, with no significant exemptions, and these are reflected, to the extent possible, in domestic FOI legislation</li>
    <li>Public is aware of and exercises right to access official information</li>
    <li>Public bodies release information both pro-actively and on demand</li>
    <li>Effective and efficient appeals mechanism via independent administrative body e.g. information commissioner or ombudsman</li>
    <li>Any restriction on grounds of protection of personal privacy is narrowly defined so as to exclude information in which there is no justifiable public interest. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The means of verification will include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Any law or policy on right to information that accords with international standards</li>
    <li>Reports from credible agencies/experts about right to information guarantees and the extent to which they reflect international standards/agreements</li>
    <li>Policies of public bodies concerning release of information (which ensure readily, freely available public access to information, including online)</li>
    <li>Evidence of state commitment to open government e.g. publication and dissemination of laws, court decisions, parliamentary proceedings, spending programmes (vis-&#xE0;-vis SDG undertakings)</li>
    <li>Statistical information about public requests for official information and their fulfilment or rejection</li>
    <li>Statistical information about appeals or complaints over information requests that have been refused</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>Data on the existence of freedom of information laws are available for at
  least 195 countries. However, for future data collection and analysis, efforts
  are underway to ensure that the data is analyzed to yield information on
  aspects relating to how FOI laws are actually &quot;implemented&quot;, rather
  than just their existence.</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>The indicator can be disaggregated in terms of the extent to which the
  residence of citizens affects their ability to access information (e.g. how do
  rural, peri-rural, urban and peri-urban dwellers access information from
  public bodies). It can also be disaggregated in terms of whether gender
  influences ability to access information. Furthermore, aspects of how
  disability affects public access to information can also be assessed.</p>
