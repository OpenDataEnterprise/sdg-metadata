  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator aims to quantify trends in: </p>

  <p>Part A: Commitment by countries to relevant multinational agreements,
  specifically:</p>

  <p>(1) National adoption of invasive alien species-relevant international
  policy. </p>

  <p>(2) Percentage of countries with </p>

  <p>(a) national strategies for preventing and controlling invasive alien
  species; and </p>

  <p>(b) national legislation and policy relevant to invasive alien species.</p>

  <p>Part B: The translation of policy arrangements into action by countries to
  implement policy and actively prevent and control invasive alien species IAS
  and the resourcing of this action, specifically:</p>

  <p>(3) National allocation of resources towards the prevention or control of
  invasive alien species.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>An &#x201C;Alien&#x201D; species is described as one which has been
  introduced outside its natural distribution range because of intentional or
  accidental dispersion by human activity. An alien species which has become
  established in a natural or semi-natural ecosystem or habitat, is an agent of
  change, and threatens native biological diversity is known as an
  &#x201C;Invasive alien species&#x201D; (Convention on Biological Diversity
  2016).</p>

  <p>The introduction of an alien species can be intentional or unintentional
  /accidental. Alien species have been introduced intentionally for forestry,
  ornamental purposes, for aquaculture/mariculture, hunting, fisheries etc.
  Examples of unintentional or accidental introductions include: alien species
  that have escaped from gardens, aquaculture containment facilities, forestry,
  horticulture; pets and aquarium species that are released in the wild;
  transport contaminants and stowaways including in ballast water or as hull
  fouling organisms, and seeds carried in soil, equipment, vehicles etc.</p>

  <p>Mechanisms of impact of invasive species include competition, predation,
  hybridisation, and disease transmission, parasitism, herbivory and trampling
  and rooting. The outcomes of these impacts lead to biodiversity loss, habitat
  degradation, and loss of ecosystem services.</p>

  <p><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></p>

  <p>The adoption of legislation does not necessarily indicate the existence of
  regulations or policy to implement the legislation or how successful such
  implementation has been on the ground. There remains a need for further
  indicator development to make this link clearer. Legislation does not
  necessarily capture all efforts against invasive alien species that are
  happening at the national level.</p>

  <p>Allocation of resources to facilitate the implementation of IAS management
  action is difficult to measure, particularly in a way that is comparable
  across countries. Proxies used to measure allocation of resources included-
  allocation of a budget line to invasive species management activities
  (including prevention, rapid response and active management); appointed staff
  to carry out any IAS related activities; active programmes/ projects etc.</p>

  <p><strong>Data sources and data collection:</strong></p>

  <p>Four datasets were updated/developed for the measurement of this
  indicator.</p>

  <p>Part A (1) Countries&#x2019; commitments to global conventions/
  international agreements relevant to invasive alien species (used for
  &#x201C;National adoption of invasive alien species-relevant international
  policy&#x201D;).</p>

  <p>Information sources comprised membership information from the Conventions
  and the United Nations Information Portal on Multilateral Environmental
  Agreements (InforMEA; <a
  href="https://www.informea.org/en"><u>https://www.informea.org/en</u></a>).
  196 countries were included. The data format is a spreadsheet of countries vs
  MEAs, with year of membership in each cell.</p>

  <p>Part A (2)(a) National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP)
  targets alignment to Aichi Biodiversity target 9 set out in the Strategic Plan
  of Biodiversity Conservation 2011-2020 and status of implementation of targets
  as described in the 5th National reports (used for &#x201C;National strategies
  for preventing and controlling invasive alien species&#x201D;).</p>

  <p>The information source was the CBD website, which features country profiles
  (<a
  href="https://www.cbd.int/countries"><u>https://www.cbd.int/countries</u></a>/
  ). 196 countries were included. The data format is a spreadsheet of countries
  vs inclusion of IAS in NBSAP, and Aichi Target 9 alignment.</p>

  <p>Part A (2)(b) National Legislation considered relevant to the prevention of
  introduction of invasive alien species and control (used for &#x201C;National
  strategies for preventing and controlling invasive alien species&#x201D;). The
  data format is a spreadsheet of countries vs inclusion of invasive alien
  species in legislation, with year of legislation in each cell. Key information
  sources included ECOLEX (<a
  href="https://www.ecolex.org/"><u>https://www.ecolex.org/</u></a>), FAOLEX (<a
  href="http://www.fao.org/faolex/en/"><u>http://www.fao.org/faolex/en/</u></a>)
  and national government websites with information on Legislation. Country
  experts were also contacted for clarifications.</p>

  <p>Part B (3) Results of online survey, disseminated to all CBD national focal
  points, on Policy responses, mandate, legal authority and resourcing to manage
  the threat of invasive alien species (used for &#x201C;National legislation
  and policy relevant to invasive alien species&#x201D; and &#x201C;National
  allocation of resources towards the prevention or control of invasive alien
  species&#x201D;). 79 countries were included. The data format is a spreadsheet
  of countries vs each of nine IAS management related themes, for both mandate
  and legal authority; and with an additional dataset indicating funding
  received from global funding mechanisms for invasive alien species related
  projects.</p>
COLL_METHOD: ''
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>National agencies producing relevant data include government,
  non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and academic institutions working
  jointly and separately. Data are gathered from published and unpublished
  sources, species experts, scientists, and conservationists through
  correspondence, workshops, and electronic fora. This indicator was first
  calculated in 2010 and includes the current 2017 update. Plans include an
  annual update and make it available for global, regional and national use.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>The next release is planned during May- June 2018.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data were collected through survey of relevant national agencies,
  specifically National Focal Points to the Convention on Biological Diversity
  (<a
  href="https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml"><u>https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</u></a>).
  These are primarily national Ministries of Environment or similar
  agencies.</p>

  <p>Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 states &#x201C;<em>By 2020, invasive alien
  species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are
  controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to
  prevent their introduction and establishment</em>&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>Under Part A, sub-indicator (1), the larger the number of invasive alien
  species -relevant international policies, the greater the level of global
  commitment to controlling invasive alien species. The more international
  agreements a country is party to, the more strongly committed the country is
  to control invasive alien species. </p>

  <p>Under Part A, sub-indicator (2)(a), effective national policy and
  legislation underpins effective national strategies and action for preventing
  and controlling invasive alien species. </p>

  <p>Measurement of Part A, sub-indicators (1) and (2)(a) was first undertaken
  in 2010, and published in Butchart et al. (2010), CBD (2014), McGeoch et al.
  (2010), and Tittensor et al. (2014). Sub-indicator (2) indicators have now
  also been added to include (b) national commitment (mandate and legal
  authority) to key invasive alien species related themes. </p>

  <p>Under Part B, the indicator now also addresses (3) resourcing by national
  governments for the prevention and control of invasive alien species, as
  identified by the Sustainable Development Goals indicator 15.8.1
  (&#x201C;Proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and
  adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien
  species&#x201D;). Adequate resourcing is vital to ensure implementation and
  effective delivery of targets set.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: ''
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>This indicator is calculated from data derived from four annually updated
  datasets.</p>

  <p>Part A (1) Countries&#x2019; commitments to global conventions/
  international agreements relevant to invasive alien species. </p>

  <p>Ten Multinational Environmental Agreements (MEAs) were used to quantify the
  trend of countries commitment to global conventions that were relevant to
  invasive alien species issues. The year of Accession and Ratification were
  noted. The ten MEAs are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</li>
    <li>OIE- World Organization for Animal Health</li>
    <li>The <em>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</em> of Wild Fauna and Flora (<em>CITES</em>) </li>
    <li>International Plant Protection Convention (<em>IPPC</em>)</li>
    <li>The <em>Ramsar</em> Convention on Wetlands of International Importance</li>
    <li>The Convention on Migratory <em>Species of Wild Animals</em></li>
    <li>The <em>Cartagena Protocol</em> on Biosafety</li>
    <li>The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&apos; Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM) </li>
    <li>WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary or <em>SPS</em> measure</li>
    <li>World Heritage Convention (WHC)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Part A (2)(a) National Legislation considered relevant to the prevention of
  introduction of invasive alien species and control. </p>

  <p>Any National Legislation, Act or regulation that had any relevance to alien
  and invasive alien species was recorded including annotations of relevant text
  of the Legislation, key words, and date of enactment. 196 countries were
  included. Legislation was considered relevant if it applied to alien and
  invasive alien species rather than solely on weeds, pests and diseases of
  agriculture. If more than one relevant piece of Legislation was enacted the
  date of the most recent one was recorded.</p>

  <p>Part A (2)(b) National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP)
  targets alignment to Aichi Biodiversity target 9 set out in the Strategic Plan
  for Biodiversity 2011-2020.</p>

  <p>Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 is focused on invasive alien species, it states
  that &#x201C;By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and
  prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are
  in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and
  establishment&#x201D;. The Aichi Targets are timebound and measurable. The CBD
  encourages all its member states to revise their NBSAPS and integrate the
  Aichi Targets into their strategies. The NBSAP of all CBD member were studied
  and numbers of countries that had integrated the Aichi Biodiversity Target 9
  into their NBSAP targets was noted </p>

  <p>Part B (3) Results of online survey on Policy responses, mandate, legal
  authority and resourcing to manage the threat of invasive alien species.</p>

  <p>An online survey was developed and submitted to all CBD nodes and focal
  points to obtain an insight into the allocation of resources to the management
  of invasive alien species. Experts from 79 of the 196 countries completed the
  survey. Considering the difficulty in obtaining information on the level of
  national investment on invasive alien species issues, proxy indicators were
  used to measure the allocation of resources by individual countries, such as
  &#x201C;does the country have a dedicated and staffed program for invasive
  alien species management&#x201D;, &#x201C;has the country applied for and
  obtained any funding from global funding mechanisms such as the GEF for
  projects related to alien and invasive alien species&#x201D;, etc. </p>

  <p>Part A and Part B Indicators were calculated as follows:</p>

  <p>Part A Indicator: Commitment by countries to relevant multinational
  agreements, and National strategies for preventing and controlling invasive
  alien species, underpinned by national policy and legislation for effective
  management of biological invasions. </p>

  <p>The components of this sub-indicator are calculated as, (1) the number of
  countries demonstrating adoption of invasive alien species-relevant
  international policy divided by the total number of countries (196 to date)
  for which data are available; (2) the number of countries with (a) national
  legislation and policy relevant to Invasive alien species concerns; and (b)
  national strategies for preventing and controlling invasive alien species,
  each divided by the total number of countries (196 to date) for which data are
  available. The first data point for components (1) and (2)(a) of this
  sub-indicator is 2010; the first data point for component (2)(b) is 2017.</p>

  <p>Part B Indicator: (3) The translation of policy arrangements into action by
  countries to implement policy and actively prevent and control invasive alien
  species and the resourcing of this action.</p>

  <p>This sub-indicator is calculated as the number of national respondents to
  the annual survey on invasive alien species response financing reporting
  availability of sufficient resources, divided by the total number of countries
  (79 to date) for which data are available. The first data point for this
  sub-indicator is 2017.</p>
