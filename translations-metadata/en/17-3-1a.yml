  <p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is defined as an investment involving a
  long-term relationship and reflecting a lasting interest and control by a
  resident entity in one economy (foreign</p>

  <p>direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an
  economy other than that of the foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or
  affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate). Please see the Methodological Note
  of UNCTAD&#x2019;s World Investment Report (<a
