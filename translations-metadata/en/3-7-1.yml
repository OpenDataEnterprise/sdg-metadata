  <p>This indicator is linked to Target 3.8 (Achieve universal health coverage,
  including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care
  services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential
  medicines and vaccines for all) because the provision of family planning
  information and methods to all individuals who want to prevent pregnancy is an
  important component of achieving universal health coverage. </p>

  <p>This indicator is also linked to Target 5.6 (Ensure universal access to
  sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance
  with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and
  Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of
  their review conferences) because meeting the demand for family planning is
  facilitated by increasing access to sexual and reproductive health-care
  services, and also improves sexual and reproductive health and the ability to
  exercise reproductive rights. </p>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) currently using a
  modern method of contraception among those who desire either to have no
  (additional) children or to postpone the next pregnancy. The indicator is also
  referred to as the demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their
  need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as
  the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the
  indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and
  unmet need for family planning. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently
  using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of
  contraception, regardless of the method used. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as
  either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female
  and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant,
  injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal
  barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam,
  jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency
  contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the
  contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception
  include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence),
  withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of
  reproductive age who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any
  method of contraception. The standard definition of unmet need for family
  planning includes women who are fecund and sexually active in the numerator,
  and who report not wanting any (more) children, or who report wanting to delay
  the birth of their next child for at least two years or are undecided about
  the timing of the next birth, but who are not using any method of
  contraception. The numerator also includes pregnant women whose pregnancies
  were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; and postpartum
  amenorrheic women who are not using family planning and whose last birth was
  unwanted or mistimed. Further information on the operational definition of the
  unmet need for family planning, as well as survey questions and statistical
  programs needed to derive the indicator, can be found at the following website
  of the USAID Demographic and Health Surveys Program: <a

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods
  is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning
  programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent
  pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to
  decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to
  have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family
  planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by
  preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at
  higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. </p>

  <p>Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75
  per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or
  less are generally considered as very low. The indicator has no global
  numerical &#x2018;target&#x2019; value set to be achieved by 2030. Looking at
  the highest values of the indicator, in 22 countries representing regions such
  as Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern
  and South-Eastern Asia, more than 85 per cent of women who want to avoid
  pregnancy are using a modern contraceptive method but for no country is this
  estimate above 91 per cent. Even in these countries, specific sub-populations
  (for example, adolescents or the poor) can still face barriers to access to
  family planning information and services. It should also be recognized that
  reaching 100 per cent may not be a necessary or even desirable outcome with
  respect to reproductive rights. Some women may prefer to use a traditional
  method, even while having access to a full range of modern methods and being
  aware of the typical differences in effectiveness of methods in preventing
  pregnancies. Other women might have ambivalent preferences regarding their
  next pregnancy which may influence their contraceptive choice.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences
  in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect
  the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range
  of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital
  or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated
  (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can
  also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by
  &#x201C;currently using&#x201D; a method of contraception. </p>

  <p>In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the
  respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can
  result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for
  traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially
  when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (by
  age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when
  analysing trends over time. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>When data on women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for married
  or in-union women is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are
  sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, sexually active
  women (irrespective of marital status), or ever-married women. Notes in the
  data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard
  definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or
  where data pertain to populations that are not representative of women of
  reproductive age. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years
  old) who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least
  one modern contraceptive method. The denominator is the total demand for
  family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the
  unmet need for family planning).</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>For surveys with microdata sets available, the indicators are calculated
  following the definitions and concepts described above. These results are
  compared with the indicators published in survey reports, SDG national
  reporting platforms, or obtained from ad hoc queries. In some cases of
  discrepancies, the results are consulted with the national institutions that
  conducted the survey.</p>

  <p>For model-based estimates and projections, out-of-sample validation methods
  are described in Kantorov&#xE1; V., M. Wheldon, P. Ueffing., A. N. Z. Dasgupta
  (2020). Estimating progress towards meeting women&#x2019;s contraceptive needs
  in 185 countries: A Bayesian hierarchical modelling study. PLoS Medicine
  17(2):e1003026. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Generally, there is no discrepancy between data presented and data
  published in survey reports. However, some published national data have been
  adjusted by the Population Division to improve comparability. Notes are used
  in the data set to indicate when adjustments were made and where data differed
  from standard definitions. Surveys might differ in the classification of
  modern and traditional methods. To improve comparability of data over time and
  across countries, method classifications used in some survey are adjusted to
  follow the classification described above. </p>

  <p>The global indicator represents all women of reproductive age. Some survey
  estimates represent women who are married or in a union and this is indicated
  in a note. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level </li>
  </ul>

  <p>There is no attempt to provide estimates for individual countries or areas
  when country or area data are not available. </p>

  <p>For the analytical and comparative purposes, the country-level model-based
  estimates and projections are generated using a Bayesian hierarchical model
  (see references below).</p>

  </ul>

  <p>In order to generate regional and global estimates for any given reference
  year, the Population Division/DESA uses a Bayesian hierarchical model,
  described in detail in: </p>

  <p>Alkema L., V. Kantorov&#xE1;, C. Menozzi and A. Biddlecom (2013). National,
  regional and global rates and trends in contraceptive prevalence and unmet
  need for family planning between 1990 and 2015: a systematic and comprehensive
  analysis. The Lancet. Vol. 381, Issue 9878, pp. 1642&#x2013;1652 </p>

  countries: A Bayesian hierarchical modelling study. PLoS Medicine
  17(2):e1003026. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Country-level, model-based estimates are only used for computing the
  regional and global averages and are not used for global SDG reporting of
  trends at the country level. However, the model-based estimates are
  recommended to be used for analytical and comparative purposes. Since the
  model takes into account the relationship of family planning indicators -
  contraceptive use of any, modern and traditional methods, unmet need for
  family planning &#x2013; the information from surveys that only provide data
  on contraceptive use (and have no information on unmet need for family
  planning) is considered as well. The model is providing estimates of the
  indicator for countries and years without direct survey data by extrapolating
  underlying trends determined using data across all countries. The model
  implicitly weights observations from other countries such that higher weights
  are given to observations from more similar countries. The fewer the number of
  observations for the country of interest, the more its estimates are driven by
  the experience of other countries, whereas for countries with many
  observations the results are determined to a greater extent by those empirical
  observations. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The Bayesian hierarchical model is used to generate regional and global
  estimates and projections of the indicator. Aggregate estimates and
  projections are weighted averages of the model-based country estimates, using
  the number of women aged 15-49 for the reference year in each country. The
  numbers of women aged 15-49 are taken from United Nations, Department of
  Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2019). World Population
  Prospects 2019. Numbers of women who are married or in a union are taken from
  United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division
  (2020). Estimates and Projections of Women of Reproductive Age Who Are Married
  or in a Union: 2020 Revision. New York: United Nations, which are estimates
  and projections based on data from United Nations, Department of Economic and
  Social Affairs, Population Division (2019). World Marriage Data 2019. </p>

  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Data for the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have
  their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods are available for
  133 countries or areas for the 2000-2020 time period. For 108 countries or
  areas, there are at least two available data points. </p>

COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Generally, there is no discrepancy between data presented and data
  published in survey reports. However, some published national data have been
  adjusted by the Population Division to improve comparability. Notes are used
  in the data set to indicate when adjustments were made and where data differed
  from standard definitions. Surveys might differ in the classification of
  modern and traditional methods. To improve comparability of data over time and
  across countries, method classifications used in some surveys are adjusted to
  follow the classification described above. </p>

  <p>The global indicator represents all women of reproductive age. Some survey
  estimates represent women who are married or in a union and this is indicated
  in a note. </p>
