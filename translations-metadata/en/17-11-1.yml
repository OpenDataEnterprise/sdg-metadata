  <p>Improvements in the transfer of environmental goods and services (target
  17.7). If the indicator is disaggregated by level of processing of the traded
  products (raw materials, semi-processed and processed) or by the level of
  diversification of the products exported, it could be also used to measure
  progress in productivity and diversification (target 8.2).</p>

  <p>Harmonized System (HS): Is the international classification used to

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Trade in goods data included in the ITC (Trade Map) database are collected
  by contacting directly focal points in national agencies or regional
  organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic communities).
  Trade in goods data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from
  official notifications of WTO members. Trade in goods data are complemented,
  when needed using the UN COMTRADE database.</p>

  <p>Trade in services data are sourced from a joint ITC/UNCTAD/WTO database,
  prevalently based on balance of payments accounts data maintained by the IMF,
  OECD and EUROSTAT. In some cases WTO jointly with UNCTAD collects information
  from national sources. Trade in services data can be retrieved by domestic
  banks and/or national statistic offices from one or more of the following
  sources:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS). In this case, international payments channelled through domestic banks are collected, generally, under the responsibility of the national central bank. Payments are used as a proxy of transactions.</li>
    <li>Enterprise surveys. Generally, under the responsibility of the national statistical office.</li>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>ITC, WTO and UNCTAD will jointly report on this indicator</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The indicator proposed allows tracking the increase of exports from
  Developing countries and LDCs prescribed by target 17.11. Using shares of
  global exports provide information on the relative size of Developing and LDCs
  export in comparison to global exports.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Export shares need to be analysed from different angles in order to infer
  whether a particular country or region made improvements in its trade
  performance. First of all, exports value should be always kept into account in
  order to observe whether changes in export shares are originating from
  increasing developing and LDCs exports or from a decrease of other countries
  exported values. Secondly, and in order to foster trade that is beneficial for
  the other SDGs, it would be useful to analyze the composition of the export
  basket by the level of processing of the goods that are traded. This will
  allow understanding whether progress are made in terms of the quality and
  value added of the products exported. In addition to that, while some exports
  like arms, oil and other natural resources would require a separate analysis,
  the calculation of export diversification indicators would be recommended to
  assess the progress made by developing and LDCs in terms of productivity and
  improvement of their export portfolio.</p>

  <p>For what concerns trade in services, it could be necessary to draw on
  supplementary data from migration, tourism, multinational companies (MNC) and
  labour market statistics, in order to provide detailed figures for Travel and
  Government services n.i.e. A typical area of interest for international trade
  in services relates to the data that may be maintained by governments on
  education and health services provided to or by non-residents (travel;
  personal, cultural and recreational services). Information obtained from
  partner countries is useful in order to validate and improve statistics of the
  compiling economy. Data from international organizations can be useful for aid
  recipient countries to compile data on technical assistance services.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>Share of global trade is intended of a particular group of country fraction
  of total trade.</p>

  <p>While for merchandise trade data are consistent through he time series
  (2000-current), for services trade there might be difficulties related to lack
  of harmonization for data previous to 2005. Before 2005 data are reported
  according the 5th Balance of Payments Manual. After 2005, data have been
  converted according to the categories and principles established by the 6th
  edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Previous year is used when latest year is not available. Alternatively
  mirror statistics can be used. Mirror statistics is the term used to define
  statistics that are calculated using partner country information when data for
  the analysed country are not available. For instance, the export of a country
  X could be recalculated using mirror statistics through the imports from
  country X of all its partners. It has to be kept in mind however imports are
  often reported CIF (i.e. including the cost of freight and insurance) while
  export FoB (i.e. free on board). The difference between these two reporting
  systems should be taken into account when using import data to estimate
  exports.</p>
