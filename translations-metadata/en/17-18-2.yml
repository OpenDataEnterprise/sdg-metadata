  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>The indicator refers to the number of countries that have national
  statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of
  Official Statistics. This refers to the number of countries that have a
  statistical legislation which respects the principles of UNFOP.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p><strong>National statistical legislation:</strong> The statistics law
  defines rules, regulation, measures with regard to the organization,
  management, monitoring and inspection of the statistical activities in a
  systematic way, strength, effectiveness and efficiency to assure the full
  coverage, accuracy and consistency with facts in order to provide reference
  for policy direction, socio economic planning, and contribute to the
  country&#x2019;s development to achieve wealth, culture, well-being and
  equity.</p>

  <p><strong>UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics:</strong></p>

  <p>The Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics adopted by the United
  Nations Statistical Commission, in its Special Session of 11-15 April 1994
  are:</p>

  <p><strong>Principle 1.</strong> Official statistics provide an indispensable
  element in the information system of a society, serving the government, the
  economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and
  environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test
  of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial
  basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens&#x2019; entitlement
  to public information.</p>

  <p><strong>Principle 2.</strong> To retain trust in official statistics, the
  statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional
  considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on
  the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and
  presentation of statistical data.</p>

  <p><strong>Principle 3.</strong> To facilitate a correct interpretation of the
  data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to
  scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the
  statistics.</p>

  <p><strong>Principle 4.</strong> The statistical agencies are entitled to
  comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. </p>

  <p><strong>Principle 5</strong>. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn
  from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative
  records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality,
  timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents. </p>

  <p><strong>Principle 6</strong>. Individual data collected by statistical
  agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal
  persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical
  purposes. </p>

  <p><strong>Principle 7.</strong> The laws, regulations and measures under
  which the statistical systems operate are to be made public. </p>

  <p><strong>Principle 8.</strong> Coordination among statistical agencies
  within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the
  statistical system. </p>

  <p><strong>Principle 9.</strong> The use by statistical agencies in each
  country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the
  consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. </p>

  <p><strong>Principle 10</strong>. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in
  statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in
  all countries.</p>
