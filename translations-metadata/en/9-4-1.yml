  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Carbon dioxide (here after, CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions per unit value added
  is an indicator computed as ratio between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel
  combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. The
  indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO<sub>2</sub>
  emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector
  (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing
  value added (MVA). </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of
  CO<sub>2</sub> per USD constant 2010 PPP GDP. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
  manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are measured in kilogrammes of
  CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per unit of MVA in constant 2015 USD.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy
  consumption data for all sectors.</p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing are based on energy data
  collected across the following subsectors (energy used for transport by
  industry is not included here but reported under transport):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];</li>
    <li>Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;</li>
    <li>Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];</li>
    <li>Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];</li>
    <li>Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];</li>
    <li>Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];</li>
    <li>Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];</li>
    <li>Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];</li>
    <li>Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) [ISIC Division 16];</li>
    <li>Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15];</li>
    <li>Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally
  agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics).
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions need to be estimated based on energy data and on
  internationally agreed methodologies (IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories).
  </p>

  <p>The IEA collects national energy data, according to internationally agreed
  energy statistics definitions and estimates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on
  the IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories Tier 1 methodology, producing
  internationally comparable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data for over 150
  countries and regions.</p>

  <p>The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each
  individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added
  generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the
  residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate consumption,
  goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the
  sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of
  National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the
  sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All
  Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>

  <p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units
  resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across
  countries, GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to calculate the
  total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions intensity of the economy. MVA is estimated in
  terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant
  prices of 2015.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The indicator CO2 emissions per unit of value added represents the amount
  of emissions from fuel combustion produced by an economic activity, per unit
  of economic output. When computed for the whole economy, it combines effects
  of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of the
  various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an economy (linked to
  the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); of the average
  efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for the manufacturing sector
  (CO2 emissions from fuel combustion per unit of manufacturing value added), it
  measures the carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic output, and its
  trends result from changes in the average carbon intensity of the energy mix
  used, in the structure of the manufacturing sector, in the energy efficiency
  of production technologies in each sub-sector, and in the economic value of
  the various output. Manufacturing industries are generally improving their
  emission intensity as countries move to higher levels of industrialization,
  but it should be noted that emission intensities can also be reduced through
  structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing. </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from
  the manufacturing processes. </p>

  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data is not systematized in many
  countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy
  data collected at national level. Energy data collection is generally well
  established, although in some cases national methodologies may differ from
  internationally agreed methodologies. National data sources include
  statistical offices, Energy Ministries, Environment agencies, among others.
  Energy consumption data and value added data are coming from different data
  sources which may raise some consistency issues.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion are estimated based on energy
  consumption and on the IPCC Guidelines.</p>

  <p>The total intensity of the economy is defined as the ratio of total
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion and GDP.</p>

  <p>The sectoral intensity is defined as CO<sub>2</sub> emission from
  manufacturing (in physical measurement unit such as tonnes) divided by
  manufacturing value added (MVA) in constant 2015 USD.</p>

  <h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the
  data at the national level:</h2>

  <p>It is important that energy data collection and emissions calculations are
  consistent with international standards. CO2 emissions need to be estimated
  based on energy data and on internationally agreed methodologies. Energy data
  are collected at a country level, based on internationally agreed standards
  (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics). The IEA collects from
  countries energy data, according to internationally agreed energy statistics
  definitions. Then, the IEA estimates CO2 emissions based on country data and
  on the IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories, producing internationally
  comparable CO2 emissions data for over 150 countries and regions. For energy
  data: the IEA sends standardised energy questionnaires (by fuel) to its
  Members and more globally to countries willing to provide data (e.g. all EU -
  jointly with Eurostat- most UNECE countries, and a few others submit these
  questionnaires). Questionnaires are available at: <a
  href="http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/questionnaires/annual/">http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/questionnaires/annual/</a>.
  For other countries, national data are processed to a consistent format.
  Therefore, the IEA is able to provide key energy statistics. More detail on
  methods and sources is available at: <a
  href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf">http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>To estimate CO2 emissions, the internationally agreed reference is the 2006
  IPCC Guidelines on GHG Inventories: <a
  href="http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/">http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/</a>.
  For the underlying energy data, the reference is the UN International
  Recommendations on Energy Statistics: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/</a>.

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <h2>Quality assurance:</h2>

  <p>The IEA has extensive data quality checks on the energy data submissions
  (around 30 statisticians working on it), and iterates with countries on data
  issues and how to address them. <a
  href="http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/questionnaires/annual/">http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/questionnaires/annual/</a>.
  The IEA also works in cooperation with the IPCC and the UNFCCC to ensure the
  highest consistency between international methodologies and methodologies
  adopted at the IEA; the IEA validates energy data submitted to the UNFCCC by
  countries within their inventories. The IEA convenes international workshops
  among partner Agencies working on energy data to ensure consistency between
  energy data at global level is enhanced continuously, and methodologies are
  harmonised.</p>

  <p>The IEA has an extensive data quality assurance and validation process
  through exchange with national data providers worldwide. It also convenes its
  Energy Statistics Development Group meeting to discuss energy statistics
  developments with its Members, and cooperates with partners worldwide to
  ensure coherence of data and methods.</p>
