  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Gross disbursements of total ODA and other official flows from all donors
  for capacity building and national planning.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p><strong>ODA</strong>: The DAC defines ODA as &#x201C;those flows to
  countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to
  multilateral institutions which are </p>

  <ol>
    <li>provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and </li>
    <li>each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and</li>
    <li>is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). </li>
  </ol>

  <p>(See <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Other official flows (OOF)</strong>: Other official flows
  (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by
  the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA,
  either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they
  are not sufficiently concessional.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through
  the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for
  commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). </p>

  <p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and
  methodologies (see here: <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a>).
  </p>

  <p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters
  in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or
  Finance, etc.</p>
