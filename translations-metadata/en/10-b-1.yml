  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and
  type of flow comprises of Official Development Assistance (ODA), other
  official flows (OOF) and private flows.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  charitable grants. Flows include contributions to multilateral development
  agencies, which are themselves official bodies. See <a
