  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator measures the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls
  aged 15 years and older who have experienced physical, sexual or psychological
  violence by a current or former intimate partner, in the previous 12 months.
  Definition of violence against women and girls and of the forms of violence
  specified under this indicator are presented in the next section
  (Concepts).</p>

  <p><u>NOTE: Due to constraints related to feasibility (as noted in the
  Feasibility section below), this indicator currently globally reports only on
  the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls aged </u><em><u>15 to
  49</u></em><u> who have experienced </u><em><u>physical and/or
  sexual</u></em><u> partner violence.</u></p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against
  Women (1993), violence against women is &#x201C;Any act of gender-based
  violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or
  psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts,
  coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or
  in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but
  not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence
  occurring in the family [&#x2026;]&#x201D;. See here for full definition:
  http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm </p>

  <p>Intimate partner violence against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a
  current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any
  other formal or informal union.</p>

  <p>The <u>different forms of violence</u> included in the indicator are
  defined as follows: </p>

  <p>1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the
  victim and include, but are not limited to acts like pushing, grabbing,
  twisting the arm, pulling hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with a
  fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on
  purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife.
  </p>

  <p>2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual
  behavior that is imposed on someone, whether by use of force, intimidation or
  coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in
  sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, non-contact
  acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In
  intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly defined as: being
  physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of
  fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to
  so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.</p>

  <p>3. Psychological violence consists of any act intended to induce fear or
  emotional distress caused by a person&#x2019;s behaviour or act. It includes a
  range of behaviors that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being
  frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for
  destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence
  by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling
  behaviours (e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking
  health care without permission). </p>

  <p>For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological
  violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence
  against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014) and the <em>International
  Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes</em> ICCS (UNODC, 2015).</p>

SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The SDG 5.2.1 Indicator Database comprises namely data from
  population-based household surveys implementing an internationally
  standardised methodology. A significant proportion of data are gathered
  through the inclusion of a Domestic Violence Module in the DHS. In addition,
  some data come from dedicated surveys on violence against women in countries
  that have implemented, for example, WHO&#x2019;s violence against women survey
  methodology. Where available, other dedicated surveys are included if the data
  are deemed comparable. All sources date from 2005 onwards.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data are collated by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against
  Women Data from data published by National Statistics Offices or other
  relevant national entities. For efficiency, some data are collated using
  existing data compiling online platforms (e.g., DHS StatCompiler). For a few
  countries, data are recalculated for harmonization regarding age group (15 to
  49) and type of intimate partner violence (any form of physical and/or sexual
  partner violence). </p>

  <p>National Statistical Offices (in most cases) or line ministries/other
  government agencies that have conducted national surveys on violence against
  women and girls.</p>

  against Women Data (UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD, WHO, UNFPA, UNODC).</p>
INST_MANDATE: ''
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence that women
  and girls face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male
  dominance over women, violence between intimate partners is often perceived as
  an ordinary/normal element of relationships, particularly in the context of
  marriage or other unions. Violence against women and girls is an extreme
  manifestation of gender inequality.</p>

  <p>Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem;
  understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify
  groups at high risk; explore the barriers to seeking help; and ensure that the
  appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point
  for informing laws, policies, and developing effective responses and
  programmes. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and
  optimally target resources to maximise the effectiveness of interventions
  (especially in resource-constrained settings).</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p><u>Comparability:</u></p>

  <p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as
  many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies,
  used different definitions of partner or spousal violence and of the different
  forms of violence and different survey question formulations, used diverse age
  groups, or used different denominators, as well as the quality of interviewer
  training. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of
  relevant concepts may also differ according to how the survey is implemented,
  and the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p>

  <p><u>Regularity of data production:</u></p>

  <p>Since 2005, only about 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on
  violence against women. Obtaining data on violence against women is a costly
  and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone
  dedicated surveys or through modules in other surveys. Demographic and Health
  Surveys (DHS) are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if
  repeated, are conducted usually with less periodicity than this. Monitoring
  this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained
  capacities are not built and financial resources are not available.</p>

  <p><u>Feasibility:</u></p>

  <p>This indicator calls for global reporting on three types of intimate
  partner violence: physical, sexual, and psychological. While there is global
  consensus on how physical and sexual intimate partner violence are generally
  defined and measured, psychological partner violence&#x2014;which may be
  conceptualised differently across cultures and in different contexts&#x2014;is
  still a Tear III sub-indicator. Since it is not yet feasible to report on
  psychological partner violence, this indicator currently reports on
  <em>physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence </em>only. Efforts are
  underway by custodian agencies to develop a global standard for measuring and
  reporting on psychological intimate partner violence. This will enable
  reporting on the three stipulated types of partner violence in the future.
  </p>

  <p>Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence
  experienced by ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above. However, a
  majority of data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49,
  and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations
  across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of
  women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is
  often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator
  therefore currently reports violence experienced by ever-partnered women and
  girls 15-49 years of age. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to
  address this issue and to better understand and measure partner violence
  against women aged 50 and above. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>This indicator calls for breakdown by form of violence and by age group.
  Countries are encouraged to compute prevalence data for each form of violence
  as detailed below to assist comparability at the regional and global
  levels:</p>

  <p><u>1. Physical violence: </u></p>

  <p>Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who
  experience physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the
  previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls
  (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 </p>

  <p><u>2. Sexual violence: </u></p>

  <p>Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who
  experience sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the
  previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls
  (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 </p>

  <p><u>3. Psychological violence: </u></p>

  <p>Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who
  experience psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in
  the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls
  (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100 </p>

  <p><u>4. Any form of physical and/or sexual violence: </u></p>

  <p>Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who
  experience physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate
  partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered
  women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100</p>

  <p><u>5. Any form of physical, sexual and/or psychological violence:</u></p>

  <p>Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who
  experience physical, sexual and/or psychological violence by a current or
  former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of
  ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100</p>

  <p><u>NOTE: To assist comparability at the regional and global level,
  countries are encouraged to </u><em><u>additionally</u></em><u> compute the
  above figures for ever-partnered </u><em><u>women aged 15 to 49</u></em><u>.
  Regional and global reporting on this indicator currently only includes data
  computed by countries for #4 above (i.e., </u><em><u>any form of physical
  and/or sexual partner violence</u></em><u>, and for the 15-49 age group). For
  further details, see Feasibility section above. </u></p>

ADJUSTMENT: ''
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>When data for a country are entirely missing, no country-level estimate is
  published. </p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>No imputations are made in cases where country data are not available.
  Where regional and global figures are presented, clear notes on data
  limitations are provided. The number of countries included in the average is
  clearly indicated. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries that make up
  the world. Regional aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries
  within the region. Weights used are the population of women and girls aged 15
  to 49 from the most recent UN population prospects. Where data are not
  available for all countries in any given region, regional aggregates may still
  be calculated. The number of countries included in the average is clearly
  indicated.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that regional and global figures should be interpreted
  with caution, as they do not necessarily represent with accuracy the region or
  world as a whole, especially for regions where population coverage is below 50
  per cent. </p>

  <p>Custodian agencies, in consultation with Member States, are currently in
  the process of producing up-to-date global, regional and country estimates,
  enhancing the quality and accuracy of 5.2.1 reporting and addressing the
  comparability challenges outlined above. New regional and global estimates are
  expected to become available in mid-2020.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries gather data on intimate partner violence through (1) specialized
  national prevalence surveys dedicated to measuring violence against women, (2)
  violence against women modules that are added to international/national
  household surveys, such as the DHS; and (3) victimization surveys</p>

  <p>Although administrative data from health, police, courts, justice and
  social services, among other services used by survivors of violence, can
  provide information on violence against women and girls, these do not provide
  prevalence data, but rather incidence data or service use (i.e., number of
  cases received in/reported to these services). Many abused women do not report
  violence and those who do, tend to be the most serious cases. Therefore,
  administrative data are not recommended to be used as a data source for this
  indicator. </p>

  against women statistics see: <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on
  Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014). </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: ''
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The Interagency Working Group on Violence against Women Data, which
  comprises all custodian agencies for this SDG indicator, thoroughly reviews
  all country data, including its primary source when deemed necessary, to
  assess quality and comparability based on exclusion/inclusion criteria agreed
  upon a priori. These criteria refer to, inter-alia, survey population
  coverage, operational definitions, methodology, and time period. All data
  points have been discussed and a consensual decision made for every data point
  included/excluded from the current SDG Indicators Database. </p>

  <p>Starting in 2020, a country consultation and validation process of data
  compiled by custodian agencies for this indicator will be undertaken,
  including with identified SDG indicators focal points and other relevant
  ministries. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: ''
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Since 2015, 139 countries had conducted violence against women national
  prevalence surveys or have included a module on violence against women in a
  DHS or other national household survey. However, not all these data are
  comparable and in many cases they are not collected on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Time series are available for some countries. Global time series with
  comparable data not yet available. </p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>In addition to form of violence and age, income/wealth, education,
  ethnicity (including indigenous status), disability status,
  marital/partnership status, relationship with the perpetrator (i.e.
  current/former partner), geographic location and frequency of violence are
  suggested as desired variables for disaggregation for this indicator. Though
  disaggregated data by these variables is not yet feasible to report on at
  regional and global levels, countries are encouraged to report these levels of
  disaggregation in their national reports; and&#x2014;whenever
  possible&#x2014;include these data for the age group 15 to 49.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>In most cases, only figures published by countries are used. However, in a
  small number of countries data may be recalculated to enhance comparability.
  Recalculation is done primarily to reflect the 15 to 49 preponderant age
  group, or to reflect the aggregate of physical and/or sexual intimate partner
  violence, for countries where this information is gathered but not published
  as such. Calculations are done using survey datasets made public by countries
  or using raw data available in published survey reports.</p>
