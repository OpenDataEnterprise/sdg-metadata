  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, broken down by
  technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a
  mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone
  subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants
  within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and
  multiplying by 100.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they
  work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the
  service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage
  should refer to LTE, broadband (3G) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular
  technologies and include:</p>

  <p><strong>2G mobile population coverage</strong>: Mobile networks with access
  to data communications (e.g. Internet) at downstream speeds below 256 Kbit/s.
  This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most
  EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of
  subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the
  number of active users of such services.</p>

  <p><strong>3G population coverage</strong>: refers to the percentage of
  inhabitants that are within range of at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal,
  irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by
  dividing the number of inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G
  mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100. It
  excludes people covered only by GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT.</p>

  <p><strong>LTE population coverage</strong>: Refers to the percentage of
  inhabitants that live within range of LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile
  WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks,
  irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by
  dividing the number of inhabitants that are covered by the previously
  mentioned mobile-cellular technologies by the total population and multiplying
  by 100. It excludes people covered only by HSPA, UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G
  technologies, and also excludes fixed WiMAX coverage.</p>

  <p>As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and
  commercialize more advanced mobile-broadband networks (5G etc.), the indicator
  will include further breakdowns.</p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>This indicator is based on an internationally agreed definition and
  methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of ITU, through
  its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with
  countries. It is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for
  Development&apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN
  Statistical Commission (last time in 2014).</p>

  <p>ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from
  national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology
  Ministries, who collect the data from Internet service providers.</p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can
  be considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides people
  with the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to
  communicate. Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded
  rapidly and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed
  when fixed-telephone networks &#x2013; often limited to urban and highly
  populated areas - were the dominant telecommunication infrastructure.</p>

  <p>While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly
  voice-based) services, higher-speed networks (3G and LTE) provide increasingly
  high-speed, reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and its
  increasing amount of information, content, services, and applications. Mobile
  networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers,
  helping people join the information society and benefit from the potential of
  ICTs, in particular in least developed countries.</p>

  <p>The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing
  basic, as well as advanced communication services and will help design
  targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address
  the digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have set
  specific targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology)
  that operators must achieve.</p>

  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Some countries have difficulty calculating overall mobile-cellular
  population coverage. In some cases, data refer only to the operator with the
  largest coverage, and this may understate the true coverage.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile network,
  broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living
  within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they
  are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the
  number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total
  population and multiplying by 100.</p>

  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Missing values are estimated using data published by mobile cellular
  operators that have the largest market share.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Missing values are estimated using data published by mobile cellular
  operators that have the largest market share.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>

  <p>Global and regional estimates are produced using weighted country-level
  data. First, the missing country-level data are estimated using data of the
  dominant mobile operator. Once all the country-level percentages are
  available, the number of people covered by the mobile signal is calculated by
  multiplying the percentage of population covered by the signal to the
  population of the country. The regional and world total population covered by
  a signal were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate
  percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population
  of respective groups.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <p>By 2015, data on 2G mobile population coverage were available for about 147
  countries, from developed and developing regions, and covering all key global
  regions. Data on 3G mobile population coverage were available for 152
  countries and data on LTE mobile population coverage were available for 124
  countries. ITU publishes data on this indicator yearly.</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>Based on the data for the percentage of the population covered by a mobile
  network, broken down by technology, and on rural population figures, countries
  can produce estimates on rural and urban population coverage. ITU produces
  global estimates for the rural population coverage, by technology.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>None. ITU uses the data provided by countries, including the in-scope
  population that is used to calculate the percentages.</p>
