  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning as defined as the
  number of deaths of unintentional poisonings in a year, divided by the
  population, and multiplied by 100 000. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Mortality rate in the country from unintentional poisonings per year. The
  ICD-10 codes corresponding to the indicator includes X40, X43-X44, X46-X49.

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Data inputs to the estimate include (a) data on WASH services and
  practices, and (b) cause-of-death data, of which the preferred data source is
  death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of
  cause of death. Other possible data sources include household surveys with
  verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and
  surveillance systems. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>WHO collects data directly from country sources, and following established
  method, estimates are shared with countries to receive their feedback before
  publication. See Indicator 6.1 above for more details. </p>

  of death. </p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Measuring how the mortality rate from unintentional poisonings provides an
  indication of the extent of inadequate management of hazardous chemicals and
  pollution, and of the effectiveness of a country&#x2019;s health system. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Data on deaths are widely available from countries from death registration
  data or sample registration systems, which are feasible systems, but good
  quality data are not yet available in all countries. Such data are crucial for
  improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. For countries
  that do not have such registration systems, data need to be completed with
  other types of information. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The methods with agreed international standards have been developed,
  reviewed and published in various documents. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of
  data available from countries. </p>

  <p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including
  information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states
  submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where
  necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death
  estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with
  verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and
  surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a
  modelling framework. </p>

  <p>The latest global, regional and country-level cause-specific mortality
  estimates, including unintentional poisonings, for the year 2000 and 2012
  (published in 2014) are available for download from the WHO website.
  http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/index1.html
  The estimates can also be accessed interactively through the Global Health
  Observatory http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/en/ </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Limited time series data is available (comparable series for years 2012 and
  soon 2015; data for 2000 are also available but have more limited
  comparability) </p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>Data can be disaggregated by age group, sex and disease. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>WHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO
  statistics, and seek feedback from countries on data about countries and
  territories. Before publishing all estimates undergo country consultations.
