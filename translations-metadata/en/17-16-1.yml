  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>The indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi
  stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development
  effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of sustainable
  development goals (SDGs). </p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>&#x201C;Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring
  frameworks&#x201D; that track effective development cooperation are monitoring
  frameworks: </p>

  <p>&#x2022; whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose
  indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development
  actors; </p>

  <p>&#x2022; where data collection and review is led by the countries
  themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves
  relevant multi-stakeholder representing, at minimum, the public sector, the
  private sector and civil society organizations.</p>

  <p>The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles
  and responsibilities of all parties involved in multi-stakeholder partnerships
  for development. It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks
  that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant
  development partners. </p>

  <p>The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global
  Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development
  effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts,
  such as the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability
  survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above
  definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by SEGIB,
  could also be considered.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The monitoring is a voluntary and country led process. Country governments
  lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are
  reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget
  department for national budget information) and by development partners and
  stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting developing countries in collecting
  relevant data on a biennial basis through the Global Partnership monitoring
  framework, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance
  at the global level. In addition, countries are increasingly
  institutionalising the data collection process within their national aid
  management systems, public financial management systems, and are reporting on
  a yearly basis. </p>

  <p>Complementarily, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social
  Affairs has been conducting a regular survey for the Development Cooperation
  Forum, in cooperation with UNDP, to identify national progress in mutual
  accountability and transparency. Survey results are assessed in comprehensive
  studies, informing global monitoring and providing practical suggestions for
  improving development results. Synergies with the measurement of indicator 7
  of the Global Partnership monitoring framework are being used. Other
  complementary sources of data (i.e. additional multi- stakeholder frameworks)
  may be incorporated in the future to provide a broader picture of progress
  made by countries towards development effectiveness in support of SDG
  implementation. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership&apos;s
  monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned from the country
  government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
  Ministry of Finance, or the Ministry of Planning. </p>

  <p>(ii) The national coordinator in turn consults with other stakeholders
  (including country offices of providers of development co-operation, Civil
  Society Organisations, the private sector, and trade unions) to gather and
  validate data.</p>

  <p>The data is then validated by headquarters offices of providers of
  development co-operation.</p>

  <p>(iii) No adjustments are made to submitted data, given that the validation
  process needs to stay at country level. However, inconsistencies or possible
  problematic values are highlighted and sent back to national co-ordinators for
  revision.</p>

  <p> </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data is collected biennially, starting from the year 2014. Monitoring
  rounds have been planned for years 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028,
  and 2030. Data generated by countries for 2016 was made available to country
  level, regional and global reporting processes on the implementation of the
  2030 Agenda.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data release at global level is scheduled for the first quarter in the year
  that immediately follows the national data gathering processes.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Leading central ministry from reporting countries. Typically the ministry
  of finance, the ministry of planning, ministry of development, or the ministry
  of foreign affairs, depending on the division of labour within each
  government.</p>

  <p>Description:</p>

  <p>Representatives from the leading ministry in country governments
  &#x2013;typically the ministry of finance, the ministry of planning, ministry
  of development, or the ministry of foreign affairs- are responsible for
  leading the national data gathering process and country-level validation.
  These representatives coordinate the data collection process at the national
  level by consolidating data and inputs from providers of development
  co-operation, Civil Society Organisations, the private sector, and trade
  unions. For global aggregation and calculation of indicator 17.16.1, country
  governments submit the data to the OECD/UNDP Joint Support Team.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>OECD and UNDP jointly compile and report the data at the global level.</p>
INST_MANDATE: ''
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires mobilizing and
  strengthening multi stakeholder partnerships that can bring and effectively
  use all the available knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources
  for sustainable development. The quality of the relationship between all the
  relevant partners defines the strength of the global partnership for
  sustainable development.</p>

  <p>The indicator provides a measure of countries&#x2019; efforts to enhance
  these multi stakeholder partnerships, and by extension the Global Partnership
  for Sustainable Development, by looking at progress made on a set of
  indicators that track how well country governments and development partners
  are working together towards sustainable development. </p>

  <p>Reflecting the spirit of the global partnership for sustainable
  development, and the universal nature of the SDGs, the indicator monitors the
  contribution and behaviour of both provider and recipient countries in
  establishing more effective, inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships to
  support and sustain the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It does so by
  measuring their respective but differentiated commitments to strengthen the
  quality of their development partnerships.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The design of the indicator has practical benefits: </p>

  <p>&#x2022; the indicator allows for relevant monitoring frameworks to be
  updated in line with evolving commitments and country specific context without
  affecting the spirit of the indicator;</p>

  <p>&#x2022; the indicator does not presume a globally-set multi-stakeholder
  framework, acknowledging the diversity of complementary efforts supporting
  effective development cooperation;</p>

  <p>&#x2022; the indicator allows participating countries to choose whether
  they would like to report as a provider of development co-operation, as a
  recipient, or both. </p>

  <p>Data collection for the Global Partnership monitoring framework is led by
  low and middle-income countries receiving development co-operation. Progress
  of countries providing development co-operation in implementing development
  effectiveness commitments is captured through their partnership behaviour in
  those low and middle-income countries. Depending on each case, middle income
  countries that currently are both recipient and providers of development
  cooperation opt to report in their role as recipient and/or provider of
  development cooperation.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>To reflect the universal nature of target 17.16 this indicator is presented
  as the global aggregate number of countries reporting progress. For any
  country reporting towards one (or more) multi-stakeholder development
  effectiveness framework(s), the country is considered to be reporting progress
  when, for the year of reference, the number of indicators within the
  framework(s) that show a positive trend is greater than the number of
  indicators that show a negative trend.</p>

  <p><u>Countries providing development co-operation funding</u> and reporting
  in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are
  assessed against the following elements: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Aligning to country-defined development objectives: </em>Percentage of new development interventions whose objectives are drawn from country-led results frameworks.</li>
    <li><em>Using country-led results frameworks: </em>Percentage of results indicators contained in new development interventions which are drawn from country-led results frameworks.</li>
    <li><em>Using national monitoring and statistical systems: </em>Percentage of results indicators in new development interventions which will be monitored using government sources and monitoring systems.</li>
    <li><em>Using national evaluation systems: </em>Percentage of new interventions that plan a final evaluation with country government involvement.</li>
    <li><em>Transparency of development co-operation</em>: Public availability of information on development co&#x2011;operation according to international reporting standards. </li>
    <li><em>Annual predictability of development co-operation</em>: Proportion of development co-operation disbursed as development partners had scheduled at the beginning of the year. </li>
    <li><em>Medium-term predictability of development co-operation: </em>forward-looking spending plans made available to the partner government (indicative annual amounts of development co-operation support to be provided over the one-to-three years. </li>
    <li><em>Development co-operation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight: share </em>of development co-operation funds planned to/for the country&#x2019;s public sevtor that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.</li>
    <li><em>Development co-operation delivered through country systems: </em>Proportion of development co-operation disbursed to a give country according to national regulations and systems for public financial management (i.e. budgeting, financial reporting, auditing) and procurement.</li>
    <li><em>Untied Aid: </em>Proportion of development co-operation that is untied<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></li>
  </ul>

  <p><u>Countries receiving development co-operation funding</u> and reporting
  in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are
  assessed against the following elements:<u> </u></p>

  <ol>
    <li><em>Leading in setting up national priorities: Countries strengthen their </em>national results frameworks.</li>
    <li><em>Creating an enabling environment for civil society organisations: </em>Civil society organizations operate within an environment that maximises their engagement in and contribution to development.</li>
    <li><em>Promoting private sector engagement and contribution to development: </em>Quality of public-private dialogue </li>
    <li><em>Recording development co-operation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight</em>: Share of development co-operation funds planned to/for the country&#x2019;s public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.</li>
    <li><em>Strengthening mutual accountability: </em>Mutual accountability among development actors is strengthened through inclusive reviews.</li>
    <li><em>Strengthening gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment: </em>Existence of transparent government systems to track public allocations for gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment </li>
    <li><em>Strengthening domestic institutions: </em>Quality of the country&#x2019;s budgetary and public financial management.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Countries providing and receiving development co-operation funding are
  invited to select whether they would like to report against provider-specific
  commitments, against recipient-specific commitments, or against both sets of
  commitments.</p>

  <p>For countries reporting both as providers and recipients of development
  co-operation, progress is calculated separately based on the respective set of
  indicators described above. Disaggregated results will show the detailed
  performance in each category. For the ultimate count of the number of
  countries making progress, dual countries are accounted as making progress if
  progress is made as recipient <strong>or</strong> as provider of development
  co-operation. </p>

  <p>The baseline for counting progress is the latest measurement available for
  each specific country, dating back to 2010. When no baseline exists for a
  country, the first measurement available for an indicator constitutes the
  baseline for future measurements of progress.</p>

  <p>When a country meets and sustains all targets for the indicators it reports
  on (i.e. it is logically impossible to make further progress) it is considered
  as &#x201C;making progress&#x201D;. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup

  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>&quot;Global aggregates are available for the 2006, 2008, and 2011 surveys
  on monitoring the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, as well as the 2013
  2014 GPEDC monitoring exercise. The 2015-2016 Global Partnership monitoring
  results will be available in September 2016. </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>The indicator presented as a global aggregate is generated through a
  bottom-up approach whereby data is collected at the country level and can
  therefore be disaggregated back at the level of countries (for both
  development cooperation providers and recipients) for national analysis and
  mutual dialogue. The data can also be further disaggregated according to
  individual indicators (i.e. specific dimensions of effective development
  cooperation) that are included within the multi- stakeholder frameworks.</p>

  <p>To foster regional policy dialogue, disaggregation at the regional level is
  possible and encouraged. Some existing platforms are already using the
  evidence for regional monitoring, learning and policy discussions (e.g. NEPAD
  in Africa, the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility in
  Asia-Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the UN Regional Economic
  Commissions). </p>
