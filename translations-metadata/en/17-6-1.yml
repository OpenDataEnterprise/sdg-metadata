  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>The indicator fixed Internet broadband subscriptions, by speed, refers to
  the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions to the public Internet, split by
  advertised download speed.</p>

  <p>The indicator is currently broken down by the following subscription
  speeds:</p>

  <p>- 256 kbit/s to less than 2 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed
  broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to,
  or greater than, 256 kbit/s and less than 2 Mbit/s.</p>

  <p>- 2 Mbit/s to less than 10 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed
  -broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to,
  or greater than, 2 Mbit/s and less than 10 Mbit/s.</p>

  <p>- Equal to or above 10 Mbit/s subscriptions (4213_G10). Refers to all fixed
  -broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to,
  or greater than, 10 Mbit/s.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-speed
  access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds
  equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL,
  fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions,
  satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is
  measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscriptions that
  have access to data communications (including the Internet) via
  mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed
  wireless technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and
  subscriptions for organizations.</p>

  <p>The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to
  a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries
  e-mail, news, entertainment and data files.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Since data for this indicator are based on administrative data from
  operators, no information on individual subscribers is available and therefore
  the data cannot be broken down by any individual characteristics. Data could
  in theory be broken down by geographic location and urban/rural, but ITU does
  not collect this information.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from
  national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology
  Ministries, who collect the data from Internet service providers.</p>

  <h2>Data collection:</h2>

  <p>Year-end data are released in June of the following year through the ITU
  World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database. </p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to provide access to
  information, and can help foster and enhance regional and international
  cooperation on, and access to, science, technology and innovations, and
  enhance knowledge sharing. High-speed Internet access is important to ensure
  that Internet users have quality access to the Internet and can take advantage
  of the growing amount of Internet content &#x2013; including user-generated
  content &#x2013; services and information.</p>

  <p>While the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions has increased
  substantially over the last years and while service providers offer
  increasingly higher speeds, fixed Internet broadband can vary tremendously by
  speed, thus affecting the quality and functionality of Internet access. Many
  countries, especially in the developing world, have not only a very limited
  amount of fixed-broadband subscriptions, but also at very low speeds. This
  limitation is a barrier to the Target 17.6 and the indicator highlights the
  potential of the Internet (especially through high-speed access) to enhance
  cooperation, improve access to science, technology and innovation, and share
  knowledge. The indicator also highlights the importance of Internet use as a
  development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not
  properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains.
  Information on fixed broadband subscriptions by speed will contribute to the
  design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.</p>

  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Since most Internet service providers offer plans linked to download speed,
  the indicator is relatively straightforward to collect. Countries may use
  packages that do not align with the speeds used for this group of indicators.
  Countries are encouraged to collect the data in more speed categories so as to
  allow aggregation of the data according to the split shown above. In the
  future, ITU might start to include higher-speed categories, reflecting the
  increasing demand and availability of higher-speed broadband
  subscriptions.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from
  national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology
  (ICT) Ministries, who collect the data from national Internet service
  providers. The data can be collected by asking each Internet service provider
  in the country to provide the number of their fixed-broadband subscriptions by
  the speeds indicated. The data are then added up to obtain the country
  totals.</p>

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <p>Data for this indicator exist for about 90 economies (in 2015). However,
  more countries are expected to provide information on this indicator over the
  next few years, which will allow ITU to produce regional and global estimates.
  Data on fixed-broadband subscriptions not broken down by speed are widely
  available, and regional and global are being produced.</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>Since data for this indicator are based on administrative data from ISPs,
  no information on individual subscribers is available and therefore the data
  cannot be broken down by any individual characteristics. Data could in theory
  be broken down by geographic location and urban/rural, but ITU does not
  collect this information.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>

  <p>Differences between global and national figures may arise when countries do
  not use the same definition for fixed-broadband subscriptions, or when speed
  tiers differ. Differences for each data point will be explained in a note.</p>
