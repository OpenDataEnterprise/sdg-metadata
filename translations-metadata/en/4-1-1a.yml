  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Percentage of children and young people achieving at least a minimum
  proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics during primary education
  (Grade 2 or 3), at the end of primary education, and at the end of lower
  secondary education. The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative
  to new common reading and mathematics scales currently in development.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p><em>Minimum proficiency level</em> <em>(MPL)</em> is the benchmark of basic
  knowledge in a domain (mathematics, reading, etc.) measured through learning
  assessments. In September 2018, an agreement was reached on a verbal
  definition of the global minimum proficiency level of reference for each of
  the areas and domains of Indicator 4.1.1 as described in the <a
  href="http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/MPLs_revised_doc_20190204.docx">Minimum
  Proficiency Levels (MPLs): Outcomes of the consensus building meeting</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment</em></p>

  <p>To ensure comparability across learning assessments, a verbal definition of
  MPL for each domain and levels between cross-national assessments (CNAs) was
  established by conducting an analysis of the performance level descriptors
  (PLDs)<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> of
  cross-national, regional, and community-led tests in reading and mathematics.
  The analysis was led and completed by the UIS and a consensus among experts on
  the proposed methodology was deemed adequate and pragmatic.</p>

  <p>The global MPL definitions for the domains of reading and mathematics are
  presented in Table 1.</p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The indicator aims to measure the percentage of children and young people
  who have achieved the minimum learning outcomes in reading and mathematics
  during or at the end of the relevant stages of education.</p>

  <p>The higher the figure the higher the proportion of children and/or young
  people reaching at least minimum proficiency in the respective domain (reading
  or mathematic) with the limitations indicated under the &#x201C;Comments and
  limitations&#x201D; section.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Learning outcomes from cross-national learning assessment are directly
  comparable for all countries which participated in the same cross-national
  learning assessments. However, these outcomes are not comparable across
  different cross-national learning assessments or with national learning
  assessments. A level of comparability of learning outcomes across assessments
  could be achieved by using different methodologies, each with varying standard
  errors. The period of 2020-2021 will shed light on the standard errors&#x2019;
  size for these methodologies. </p>

  <p>The comparability of learning outcomes over time has additional
  complications, which require, ideally, to design and implement a set of
  comparable items as anchors in advance. Methodological developments are
  underway to address comparability of assessments outcomes over time. </p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The number of children and/or young people at the relevant stage of
  education n in year t achieving or exceeding the pre-defined proficiency level
  in subject s expressed as a percentage of the number of children and/or young
  people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject
  s.</p>

  <p>MPL<sub>t,n,s,</sub> = MP<sub>t,n,s</sub> / P<sub>t,n</sub></p>

  <p>where: </p>

  <p>MP<sub>t,n,s</sub> = the number of children and young people at stage of
  education n, in year t, who have achieved or exceeded the minimum proficiency
  level in subject s. </p>

  <p>P<sub>t,n </sub>= the number of children and young people at stage of
  education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.</p>

  <p>n = the stage of education that was assessed</p>

  <p>s = the subject that was assessed (reading or mathematics).</p>

  <h2>Harmonize various data sources</h2>

  <p>To address the challenges posed by the limited capacity of some countries
  to implement cross-national, regional, and national assessments, actions have
  been taken by the UIS and its partners. The strategies are used according to
  its level of precision and following a <a
  href="http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/GAML6-WD-2-Protocol-for-reporting-4.1.1_v1.pdf">reporting
  protocol</a> that includes the national assessments under specific
  circumstances. </p>

  <h2>Out-of-school children </h2>

  <p>In 2016, 263 million children, adolescents and youth were out of school,
  representing nearly one-fifth of the global population of this age group. 63
  million, or 24% of the total, are children of primary school age (typically 6
  to 11 years old); 61 million, or 23% of the total, are adolescents of lower
  secondary school age (typically 12 to 14 years old); and 139 million, or 53%
  of the total, are youth of upper secondary school age (about 15 to 17 years
  old). Not all these kids will be permanently outside school, some will re-join
  the educational system and, eventually, complete late, while some of them will
  enter late. The quantity varies per country and region and demands some
  adjustment in the estimate of Indicator 4.1.1. There is currently a discussion
  on how to implement these adjustments to reflect all the population. In 2017,
  the <a
