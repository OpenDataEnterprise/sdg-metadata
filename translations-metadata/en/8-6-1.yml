  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>This indicator conveys the proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in
  education, employment or training (also known as &quot;the youth NEET
  rate&quot;).</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>For the purposes of this indicator, youth is defined as all persons between
  the ages of 15 and 24 (inclusive).</p>

  <p>According to the International Standard Classification of Education
  (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication
  designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as
  education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public
  organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up
  the formal education system of a country. Non-formal education, like formal
  education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized,
  intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an
  addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short
  in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form
  of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED
  as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not
  institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either
  formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning
  activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local
  community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or
  socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be
  considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as
  described above, but excluding informal learning.</p>

  <p>Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short
  reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or
  provide services for pay or profit.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this indicator, persons are considered to be in
  training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they
  acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. Vocational
  training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical
  activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related
  to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other
  hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in
  particular those of technicians and middle managers. </p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a
  household-based labour force survey. </p>

  <p>In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other
  type of household surveys with an appropriate employment module may be used to
  obtain the required data. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>The ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual questionnaire to all
  relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour
  ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data available and any revisions
  on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG
  indicators. Indicator 8.6.1 is calculated from statistics submitted to the ILO
  via this questionnaire as well as through special agreements with regional and
  national statistical offices or through the processing of microdata sets of
  national labour force surveys.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <h1>Calendar</h1>

  <h2>Data collection:</h2>

  <p>The ILO sends out its annual ILOSTAT questionnaire on labour statistics,
  usually in the 2nd quarter, with a view to receiving the requested statistics
  by the 3rd quarter or the end of the year at the latest. Data received in
  batch from regional and national statistical offices and data obtained through
  the processing of microdata sets of national household surveys by the ILO
  Department of Statistics are continuously updated in ILOSTAT (as they become
  available to the ILO Department of Statistics).</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <h2>Data release:</h2>

  <p>The ILOSTAT database is continuously updated to reflect statistics compiled
  and processed every week. In general, statistics for EUROSTAT and OECD
  countries are available around the 2nd or 3rd quarter of the year following
  the year of reference, whereas they are usually available around the 3rd or
  4th quarter of the year following the year of reference for the other
  countries.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <h1>Data providers</h1>

  <p>Mainly national statistical offices, and in some cases labour ministries or
  other related agencies, at the country-level. In some cases, regional or
  international statistical offices can also act as data providers.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The share of youth not in employment, education or training (youth NEET
  rate) provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, not
  in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure of
  potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. It includes
  discouraged worker youth as well as those who are outside the labour force due
  to disability or engagement in household chores, among other reasons. Youth
  NEET is also a better measure of the current universe of potential youth
  labour market entrants as compared with the youth inactivity rate, as the
  latter includes those youth who are outside the labour force and are in
  education, and thus are furthering their skills and qualifications.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>The calculation of this indicator requires to have reliable information on
  both the labour market status and the participation in education or training
  of young persons. The quality of such information is heavily dependent on the
  questionnaire design, the sample size and design and the accuracy of
  respondents&apos; answers. </p>

  <p>In terms of the analysis of the indicator, in order to avoid
  misinterpreting it, it is important to bear in mind that it is composed of two
  different sub-groups (unemployed youth not in education or training and youth
  outside the labour force not in education or training). The prevalence and
  composition of each sub-group would have policy implications, and thus, should
  also be considered when analysing the NEET rate.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>Youth NEET rate =</p>

  <p>(Youth &#x2013; (Youth in employment + Youth not in employment but in
  education or training))/Youth) x 100</p>

  <p>It is important to note here that youth simultaneously in employment and
  education or training should not be double counted when subtracted from the
  total number of youth.</p>

  <p>The formula can also be expressed as:</p>

  <p>Youth NEET rate =</p>

  <p>((Unemployed youth + Youth outside the labour force) &#x2013; (Unemployed
  youth in education or training + Youth outside the labour force in education
  or training)) Youth x 100</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute
  missing values at the country level. The additional variables used for the
  imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market and school
  enrolment data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to
  calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for
  international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. </p>

  <p>For further information on the estimates, please refer to the the ILO
  modelled estimates methodological overview, available at <a
  href="https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf">https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf</a>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>
REG_AGG: >-
  <h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>

  <p>The NEET aggregates are derived from the ILO modelled estimates that are
  used to produce global and regional estimates of, amongst others, rates of
  youth not in employment. These models use multivariate regression and
  cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country level,
  which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. The
  regional and global NEET rates are obtained by first adding up, across
  countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that defines NEET
  rates as outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired
  level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to produce the NEET
  rate for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this direct
  aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing observations.
  For further information on the estimates, please refer to the the ILO modelled
  estimates methodological overview, available at <a

  <h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the
  data at the national level:</h2>

  <p>In order to calculate this indicator, reliable data are needed on both the
  labour market situation and the participation in the educational system of the
  youth. These data are collected at the national level mainly through labour
  force surveys (or other types of household surveys with an employment module).
  For the methodology of each national household survey, one must refer to the
  most comprehensive survey report or to the methodological publications of the
  national statistical office in question.</p>
