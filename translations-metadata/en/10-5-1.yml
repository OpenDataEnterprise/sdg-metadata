  <p>Linkages with any other Goals and Targets: Recommendation II.2 of G-20 Data
  Gap Initiative &#x2013; 2 concerns FSIs. Its target is by 2021, G-20 economies
  to report the seven FSIs expected from the Special Data Dissemination
  Standards Plus (SDDS Plus) adherent economies on a quarterly frequency, with a
  timeliness of one quarter. The seven SDG FSIs are the same as the FSIs under
  SDDS, but with one exception under SDDS Plus, where resident real estate price
  index is used instead of net open position in foreign exchange to capital.</p>

  <p>Seven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as
  percent.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets </li>
    <li>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets </li>
    <li>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital </li>
    <li>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans </li>
    <li>Return on assets </li>
    <li>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities </li>
    <li>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</em></strong>: This is the
  ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) assets. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted
  assets</em></strong><em>:</em> It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1
  capital as the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data
  for this FSI are compiled in accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I,
  Basel II, or Basel III. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to
  capital</em></strong><em>:</em> This FSI is calculated by taking the value of
  nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as
  the numerator and capital as the denominator. Capital is measured as total
  regulatory capital. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross
  loans</em></strong><em>:</em> This FSI is calculated by using the value of
  NPLs as the numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including
  NPLs, and before the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions) as the
  denominator. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Return on assets</em></strong><em>:</em> This FSI is calculated
  by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes (as
  recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial
  and nonfinancial) over the same period. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities</em></strong>: This FSI
  is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as the numerator and
  short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by
  taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions
  that have implemented Basel III, this indicator could be supplemented with the
  liquidity coverage ratio.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital</em></strong>:
  The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated based on the
  recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital
  should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is
  a supervisory concept. </p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</em></strong><em>:</em>
  Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending
  on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet
  (non-risk weighted) assets. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted
  assets</em></strong>: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel
  I, II, or III depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices.
  Denominator is risk-weighted assets also calculated based on Basel standards.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to
  capital</em></strong><em>:</em> A loan is classified as NPL when payment of
  principal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that
  a full or partial amount of a loan is not going to be recovered. Only specific
  loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they refer charges
  against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs.
  Capital is measured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I,
  II, or III depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross
  loans</em></strong><em>:</em> A loan is classified as NPL when payment of
  principal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that
  a full or partial amount of a loan is not going to be recovered. The
  denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and
  before the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Return on assets</em></strong>: The numerator is annualized net
  income before extraordinary items and taxes. The denominator is the average
  value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities</em></strong><em>:</em>
  Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and other
  financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures
  equal core measure plus securities traded in liquid markets that can be
  converted into cash with minimal change in value. The denominator is
  short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of
  financial derivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial
  derivatives liability position minus financial derivative asset position.
  Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining
  maturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can
  be used as an alternative.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital</em></strong>:
  The net open position in foreign exchange equals the foreign-currency and
  foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
  exposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of
  balance sheet liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures.
  Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in national
  currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to
  foreign exchange risk. The denominator is total regulatory capital as defined
  above. </p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</em></strong>: It is a more
  stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the extent to which
  assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy
  of the deposit-taking sector. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted
  assets</em></strong>: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers based
  on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
  (BCBS). Capital adequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of
  robustness of financial institutions to withstand shocks to their balance
  sheets. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to
  capital</em></strong><em>:</em> This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an
  important indicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from
  NPLs that are not covered by specific loan loss provisions. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans</em></strong>: This
  FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is intended to identify
  problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Return on assets</em></strong>: It is an indicator of bank
  profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers&#x2019; efficiency in
  using their assets. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities</em></strong>: It is a
  liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity mismatch of assets
  and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit
  takers can meet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity
  problems. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong><em>Net open position in foreign exchange to
  capital</em></strong><em>:</em> This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to
  market risk, which is intended to gauge deposit takers&#x2019; exposure to
  exchange rate risk compared with capital. It measures the mismatch of foreign
  currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to exchange
  rate movements.</p>

  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Data for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few
  countries report data on a semi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a
  quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters. Some
  countries&#x2019; compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology
  in certain areas and are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the
  IMF&#x2019;s FSI website. Reporting countries provide all or most core FSIs
  and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of
  these seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are
  available at <a
  href="http://data.imf.org/FSI.">http://data.imf.org/FSI.</a></p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on
  &#x201C;Definition&#x201D; above. The common source data are data reported by
  banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by
  banks&#x2019; supervisory authorities and complete reporting is usually
  mandated by law.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels.</p>
REG_AGG: |-
  <h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>
  <p>The FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the
  data at the national level:</h2>

  <p>The FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at <a
  href="http://data.imf.org/FSI">http://data.imf.org/FSI</a>.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <h2>Quality assurance:</h2>

  <p>The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes.
  National supervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI
  compilers. IMF staff check the FSIs reported by countries before posting on
  the FSI website and address data issues in collaboration with the national
  compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and consistency
  checks implemented in the IMF data processing system. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters. All countries report
  all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the
  interpretation of these seven SDG indicators. </p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>Data for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few
  countries report data on a semi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a
  quarter. Data are available as far back as 2005 for some countries.</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a
  whole (e.g., deposit takers, other financial corporations, nonfinancial
  corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and relevant
  subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not
  applicable, an explanation is provided in the metadata. There are no
  disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to the IMF.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>

  <p>Data calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs
  disseminated by the IMF due to the use of different compilation methodology
  and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are compiled
  based on the <em>FSI Compilation Guide</em>, which provides the guidance on
  the concepts and definitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation
  of cross-country comparable data to support national and international
  surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible
  discrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that
  detail departures from recommendations in the <em>FSI Guide</em>.</p>
