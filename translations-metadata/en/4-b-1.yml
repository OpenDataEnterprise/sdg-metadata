  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Gross disbursements of total ODA from all donors for scholarships.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p><strong><em>ODA:</em></strong> The DAC defines ODA as &#x201C;those flows
  to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to
  multilateral institutions which are </p>

  <ol>
    <li>provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and </li>
    <li>each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and</li>
    <li>is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm</a>)</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong><em>Scholarships:</em></strong> Financial aid awards for individual
  students and contributions to trainees. The beneficiary students and trainees
  are nationals of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral
  grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or public
  institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or training
  courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs of students attending
  schools financed by the donor but not receiving individual grants are not
  included here, but under item imputed student costs (CRS sector code 1520).
  Training costs relate to contributions for trainees from developing countries
  receiving mainly non-academic, practical or vocational training in the donor
  country.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through
  the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for
  commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). </p>

  <p>Data for scholarships are only available since 2010 when the new typology
  of aid was introduced in DAC statistics.</p>

  <p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and
  methodologies (see here: <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a>).
  </p>

  <p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters
  in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or
  Finance, etc.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics
  in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the
  national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <h1>Calendar</h1>

  <h2>Data collection:</h2>

  <p>Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous
