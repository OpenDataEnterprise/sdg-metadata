  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Proportion of total number of tariff lines (in per cent) applied to
  products imported from least developed countries and developing countries
  corresponding to a 0% tariff rate in HS chapter 01-97.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p><strong><em>Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL):</em></strong>
  National Tariff Line codes refer to the classification codes, applied to
  merchandise goods by individual countries, that are longer than the HS six
  digit level. Countries are free to introduce national distinctions for tariffs
  and many other purposes. The national tariff line codes are based on the HS
  system but are longer than six digits. For example, the six digit HS code
  010120 refers to Asses, mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National
  Tariff line code 010120.10 refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20
  refers to live asses other than purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers
  to mules and hinnies imported for immediate slaughter.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Tariffs:</em></strong> Tariffs are customs duties on
  merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis (percentage of
  value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to
  create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising
  government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to be
  tariffs.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The main information used to calculate indicators 10.a.1 is import tariff
  data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting directly
  National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, regional
  organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in charge of
  customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue authorities)
  or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the calculation of
  this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - <a
  href="http://www.macmap.org/%20">http://www.macmap.org/</a> - WTO (IDB) - <a
  href="http://tao.wto.org">http://tao.wto.org</a> - and UNCTAD (TRAINS)
  databases. Import tariff data included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are
  collected by contacting directly focal points in line national agencies or
  regional organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic
  communities). When available, data are downloaded from national or regional
  official websites. In some cases, data are purchased from private companies.
  Import tariff data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from
  official notifications of WTO members. Import tariff included in the UNCTAD
  (TRAINS) database are collected from official sources, including official
  country or regional organizations websites.</p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>ITC, WTO and UNCTAD will jointly report on this indicator</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The calculation of this indicator will allow observing on how many products
  Developing countries and LDCs will have free access to Developed countries
  markets. When compared to the tariff rates applied to other countries, this
  indicator will allow assessing to which extent special and differential
  treatment has been accorded in terms of import tariffs. The evolution of this
  indicator will indicate progress on the phasing out of tariff rates on goods
  coming from Developing and LDCs.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>The following caveats should be taken in consideration while reviewing this
  indicator:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Accurate estimates on special and differential treatment for developing countries do not exist, thus the calculations are limited to tariffs only. These are only part of the trade limitation factors, especially when looking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential treatment that set criteria for eligibility.</li>
    <li>A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries are used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries&apos; exporters for different reasons such as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin). As there is no accurate statistical information on the extent of the actual utilisation of each of these preferences, it is assumed that they are fully utilised.</li>
    <li>Duty free treatment is an indicator of market access, but is not always synonymous with preferential treatment for beneficiary countries, because a number of MFN tariffs are already at, or close to, zero, especially for fuels and minerals. International agreements on IT products also offer duty-free treatment for components and equipment used for production purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The indicator is calculated as the average share of national tariff lines
  that are free of duty.</p>
