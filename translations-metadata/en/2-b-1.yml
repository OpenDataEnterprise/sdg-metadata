  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Agricultural export subsidies are defined as export subsidies budgetary
  outlays and quantities as notified by WTO Members in Tables ES:1 and
  supporting Tables ES:2 (following templates in document G/AG/2 dated 30 June
  1995).</p>

  <p>Data cover:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Notifications by WTO Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules;</li>
    <li>Notifications of export subsidies by developing country Members pursuant to the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other WTO Members are not entitled to use export subsidies and their
  notifications are therefore not recorded in the indicator series.</p>

  <p>Budgetary outlays and quantities are expressed in a currency (national or
  other) and in quantity units as per Member&apos;s notification practices. For
  Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their
  Schedules, the currency used in the notifications is similar to the one used
  in the Schedules.</p>

  <p>Data are available by country and by products or groups of products,
  according to Members&apos; schedules for Members with export subsidy reduction
  commitments included in part IV of their Schedules and according to
  Member&apos;s notification practices in the case of developing country Members
  using export subsidies under the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on
  Agriculture.&quot;</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The sources of data are WTO Members&apos; notifications in their Table ES:1
  and supporting table ES:2 notifications, pursuant to the notification
  requirements and formats adopted by the WTO Committee on Agriculture and
  contained in document G/AG/2.</p>

  <h1>Calendar</h1>

  <h2>Data collection:</h2>

  <p>Data are collected on a regular basis, following the timing of WTO
  Members&apos; notification submissions. </p>

  <h1>Data compilers</h1>

  <h2>Name:</h2>

  <p>WTO</p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The WTO is receiving WTO Members notifications and compiling the
  information contained in these notifications to report on this indicator.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The purpose of this indicator is to give detailed information on the level
  of export subsidies applied annually per product or group of products, as
  notified by WTO Members.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>The quality of the indicator depends on WTO Members&apos; timeliness and
  accuracy of their notifications.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The country level data come directly from Members&apos; notifications to
  the WTO and are not subject to any computation by the WTO. Each WTO Member
  collects data following his own national practice to prepare his
  notification.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Values are missing when a WTO Member has not submitted their notification.
  Missing values cannot be estimated.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Not relevant. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>

  <p>The WTO does not calculate regional aggregates.</p>

  <p>An overall global indicator measuring the total annual applied export
  subsidies budgetary outlays is calculated by summing all the available data
  after having converted them into a single currency (US$).</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Cf. latest revision of WTO document series G/AG/GEN/86 (table under section
  2.4 &#x2013; Members with shaded cells) for a detailed description of data
  availability for export subsidies notified by Members with export subsidy
  reduction commitments.</p>

  <p>In addition, 10 developing country Members notified since 1995 the use of
  export subsidies, pursuant to the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement
  on Agriculture.</p>

  <p>Contrary to the information for developed country Members with export
  subsidy reduction commitments that is available for all notified years,
  information for developing country Members using export subsidies, pursuant to
  the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture is available
  only for the years during which these export subsidies were used.</p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>Since 1995 </p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>The indicator gives country and product based information on the level of
  applied export subsidies, both in terms of budgetary outlays and
  quantities.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>

  <p>The WTO does not estimate data. Only data contained in WTO Members&apos;
  notifications are used. Therefore, there is no difference between country
  produced data and data available at the WTO.</p>
