  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>This is a twin indicator consisting of:</p>

  <p>A) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of
  biodiversity, defined as gross disbursements of total Official Development
  Assistance (ODA) from all donors for biodiversity. </p>

  <p>B) Revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant
  economic instruments, defined as revenue generated and finance mobilised from
  biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, covering biodiversity-relevant
  taxes, fees and charges, and positive subsidies. (New on-going work is
  underway to collect data on payments for ecosystem services and biodiversity
  offsets -- including the finance they mobilise for biodiversity).</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>A) The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as those flows to
  countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and multilateral
  institutions which are:</p>

  <p>1) Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or
  by their executive agencies; and</p>

  <p>2) Each transaction of which:</p>

  <p>a) is administered with the promotion of the economic development and
  welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and</p>

  <p>b) is concessional in character.</p>

  <p><em> </em>(See <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm</a>).</p>

  <p>B) The Environmental Policy Committee (EPOC) collects data on Policy
  Instruments for the Environment (to the OECD PINE database), including
  biodiversity-relevant economic instruments. Currently more than 110 countries
  are contributing data. For 2020 data, see <a

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>A) The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through
  the CRS (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an
  activity level and 2002 for disbursements). The Rio marker for biodiversity
  was introduced in 2002. The data are provided by DAC donors, other bilateral
  providers of development cooperation and multilateral organizations. </p>

  <p>B) Information for the OECD PINE database is collected via a network of 200
  country experts, including in government agencies (Ministries of Finance and
  Environment, statistical institutes) as well as research institutes and
  international organisations. Data is collected systematically for 37 OECD
  members as well as the active accession countries. A growing number of
  non-member countries also provide information. Currently, more than 110
  countries are contributing data. Registered experts are asked to update data
  at least once a year, typically in January or February, through a
  password-protected interface. The data collection method may result in some
  reporting bias, as OECD members and active accession countries are likely to
  report more data on a regular basis, and all figures should be interpreted in
  this context.</p>

  <h1>Data providers</h1>

  <p>A) A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC
  statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located
  in the national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>

  <p>B) Information for the PINE database is collected via a network of 200
  country experts, including in government agencies (Ministries of Finance and
  Environment, statistical institutes) as well as research institutes and
  international organisations. Data is collected systematically for 37 OECD

  <p>The OECD Secretariat, in consultation with countries, validates the data
  before they are published online. The management of PINE is overseen by OECD
  Committees and Working Parties.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>A) Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort that
  donors provide to developing countries for biodiversity.</p>

  <p>B) Economic policy instruments can either generate revenue (e.g.
  biodiversity-relevant taxes) or mobilise finance directly for biodiversity
  conservation and sustainable use (e.g. biodiversity-relevant fees and charges;
  positive subsidies; PES and offsets) which is finance mobilised at domestic
  level. </p>

  <p>The data are collected in a consistent and comparable way across
  countries.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>A) OECD CRS data are available since 1973. However, the data coverage at an
  activity level is considered complete from 1995 for commitments and 2002 for
  disbursements. The Rio biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002.</p>

  <p>B) The OECD PINE database tracks the biodiversity-relevant economic
  instruments that countries have put in place, and countries are encouraged to
  also provide information on the revenue and finance channelled via each of the
  instruments. The comprehensiveness of data provided currently varies across
  the biodiversity-relevant economic instruments. The data on revenue generated
  by biodiversity-relevant taxes is currently the most comprehensive. For the
  data on biodiversity-relevant fees and charges, for example, of the total
  number of these instruments currently reported to the PINE database, 42% also
  include data on the finance they generate. </p>

  <p>Like all data provided by a diffuse set of respondents, the data is subject
  to missing values, human error, and differences in interpretation of the
  provided definitions. However, all possible efforts have been made to ensure
  that the data is complete, accurate, and comparable across countries.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>A) This indicator is calculated as the sum of all ODA flows from all donors
  to developing countries that have biodiversity as a principal or significant
  objective, thus marked with the Rio marker for biodiversity.</p>

  <p>B) Countries are requested to report on when the policy instrument was
  introduced, what it applies to, the geographical coverage, the environmental
  domain, the industries concerned; the revenues, costs or rates; whether the
  revenue is earmarked; and exemptions.</p>

  <p>B) The OECD provides instructions and a formatted questionnaire for
  countries to provide data.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <h2>Quality assurance:</h2>

  <p>A) The data collected by the OECD/DAC Secretariat are official data
  provided by national statistical reporters in each providing country/agency.
  The OECD/DAC Secretariat is responsible for checking, validating and
  publishing these data. </p>

  <p>B) Data are provided by competent national authorities. The OECD
  Secretariat conducts regular checks to identify errors or missing data.</p>

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>A) The Rio biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002 and data are
  available since then for most DAC members, with improvements in reporting over
  time. Not all other providers report their data at an activity level
  though.</p>

  <p>Provisional data classification: Tier I</p>

  <p>B) Currently more than 110 countries are contributing data to the PINE
  database. As of March 2020, the database contained more than 3 500 policy
  instruments for the environment, of which 3 100 were in force. The
  environmental domains covered by the database include biodiversity, climate,
  air pollution, among others.</p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>A) The data are available since 1996 on an annual basis, with time series
  since 1950.</p>

  <p>B) The data series is annual and data is available from before 1980. </p>

  <p>The PINE database exists since 1996, with the added feature of tagging
  biodiversity-relevant instruments introduced in 2017. The
  biodiversity-relevant information in the PINE database is being used to
  monitor progress towards Aichi Target 3 on positive incentives, under the
  Convention on Biological Diversity. For more information on this, see Aichi
  Target 3 under the website of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership
  (BIP).</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>A) This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, by recipient country (or
  region), by type of finance, by type of aid, by sub-sector, by policy marker
  (e.g. gender), etc.</p>

  <p>B) Information is available by country at the individual policy instrument
  level.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>

  <p>A) DAC statistics are standardized on a calendar year basis for all donors
  and may differ from fiscal year data available in budget documents for some
  countries. Some countries provide more comprehensive information than
  others.</p>

  <p>B)<strong> </strong>Some countries provide more comprehensive information
  than others.</p>
