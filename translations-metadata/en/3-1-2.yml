  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally
  doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of childbirths attended by
  professional health personnel. According to the revised definition<sup>1</sup>
  these are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated,
  trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are
  competent to: (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based,
  quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns;
  (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a
  clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or
  refer women and/or newborns with complications.Traditional birth attendants,
  even if they receive a short training course, are not included. </p>

CLASS_SYSTEM: ''
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>National-level household surveys are the main data sources used to collect
  data for skilled health personnel SBA. These surveys include Demographic and
  Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Reproductive
  Health Surveys (RHS) and national surveys based on similar methodologies. The
  surveys are undertaken every 3 to 5 years. For mainly industrialized countries
  (where the coverage is high), data sources include routine service statistics.
  </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>UNICEF and WHO maintain joint databases on skilled attendance at delivery
  (e.g. doctor, nurse or midwife or any additional qualified category) and both
  collaborate to ensure the consistency of data sources. These surveys include
  Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
  (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and national surveys based on
  similar methodologies. The surveys are undertaken every 3 to 5 years. For
  mainly industrialized countries (where the coverage is high), data sources
  include routine service statistics. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Before acceptance into the joint global databases, UNICEF and WHO undergo a
  country consultation that consists of an updating and verification process
  that includes correspondence with field offices to clarify any questions
  regarding estimates. During this process, the national categories of skilled
  health personnel are verified, and so the estimates for some countries may
  include additional categories of trained personnel beyond doctors, nurses, and
  midwives.</p>

  <p> </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>As the main source of data is household surveys which are conducted every
  3-5 years, the collection of data are under this schedule. When data comes
  from administrative source, data can be available on an annual basis. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Estimates are published annually, in May by WHO in World Health Statistics

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Having a skilled attendant at the time of childbirth is an important
  lifesaving intervention for both women and babies. Not having access to this
  key assistance is detrimental to women&apos;s health because it could cause
  the death of the women or long lasting morbidity, especially in vulnerable
  settings. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: ''
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth attended by a skilled
  health personnel (e.g. doctors, nurses or midwives) during delivery is
  expressed as a percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same
  period. </p>

IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level </li>
  </ul>

  <p>There is no treatment of missing values at country level. If value is
  missing for a given year, then there is no reporting of that value. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <ul>
    <li>At regional and global levels </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Missing values are not imputed for regional and global levels. The latest
  available year within each period is used for the calculation of regional and
  global average. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional and global estimates are calculated using weighed averages. Annual
  number of births from United Nations Population Division, World Population
  Prospects<sup>2</sup> is used is as a weighing indicator. Regional values are
  calculated for a reference year, including a range of 4-5 years for each
  reference year. For example, for 2019, the latest year available for the
  period 2014--2019 was used. </p>

  <p>UNICEF and WHO maintain a joint databases on skilled attendance at

  Surveys (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and national surveys based

  some countries, for example in high-income regions (where the coverage is
  high), data sources include routine service statistics. </p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: ''
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Data are reported to UNICEF on an annual basis. Values are reviewed and
  assess to make sure that reported indicator complies with standard definition
  and methodology. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>As part of the country consultation, data are reported by UNICEF country
  office or statistical offices in country to UNICEF-HQ for global compilation.
  At the national levels, country offices are in touch with national authorities
  to compile and provide requested data, and therefore, values reported in
  global database are validated by national authorities. </p>

COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability: </p>

  <p>Data are available for over 170 countries. </p>

  <p>The lag between the reference year and actual production of data series
  depends on the availability of the household survey for each country. </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>1990-2019 </p>

  <p>Disaggregation: </p>

  <p>For this indicator, when data are reported from household surveys,
  disaggregation is available for various socio-economic characteristics
  including residence (urban/rural), household wealth (quintiles), education
  level of the mother, maternal age, geographic regions. When data are reported
  from administrative sources, disaggregation is more limited and tend to
  include only residence. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong> </p>

  <p>Discrepancies are possible if there are national figures compiled at the
  health facility level. These would differ from the global figures, which are
  typically based on survey data collected at the household level. </p>

  <p>In terms of survey data, some survey reports may present a total percentage
  of births attended by a skilled health professional that does not conform to
  the SDG definition (e.g., total includes provider that is not considered
  skilled, such as a community health worker). In that case, the percentage
  delivered by a physician, nurse, or a midwife are totalled, consulted with the
  country and included in the global database as the SDG estimate. </p>

  <p>In some countries where the indicator on skilled attendant at birth is not
  actively reported, birth in a health facility (institutional births) is used
  as a proxy indicator. This is frequent countries in the Latin America region
  or in European and Central Asian regions, where the proportion of
  institutional births is very high. Nonetheless, it should be noted that
  institutional births may underestimate the percentage of births with skilled
  attendant. </p>
