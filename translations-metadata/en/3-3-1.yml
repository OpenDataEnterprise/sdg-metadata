  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>The number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex,
  age and key populations as defined as the number of new HIV infections per
  1000 person-years among the uninfected population.</p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Spectrum modelling, household or key population surveys with HIV
  incidence-testing,</p>

  <p>Other possible data sources: Regular surveillance system among key
  populations.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>Country teams use UNAIDS-supported software to develop estimates annually.
  The country teams are comprised of primarily epidemiologists, demographers,
  monitoring and evaluation specialists and technical partners.</p>

  <p>The software used to produce the estimates is Spectrum&#x2014;developed by
  Avenir Health (www.avenirhealth.org)&#x2014;and the Estimates and Projections
  Package, which is developed by the East-West Center (<a
  href="www.eastwestcenter.org">www.eastwestcenter.org</a>). The UNAIDS
  Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections provides technical
  guidance on the development of the HIV component of the software (<a
  href="www.epidem.org">www.epidem.org</a>).</p>

  <p>Data sources are compiled all year long. The spectrum models are created in
  the first three months of every year and finalized by June. The next report
  will be in July 2020. </p>

  <p>The estimates are produced by a team consisting of ministry of health,

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The incidence rate provides a measure of progress toward preventing onward
  transmission of HIV.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>Longitudinal data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely
  available for large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from
  health facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence
  is thus modelled using the Spectrum software.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Estimates are not collected from countries with populations &lt; 250,000.
  In addition no estimates are available for 10 countries with very small HIV
  epidemics who do not produce estimates. For some countries the estimates were
  not finalized at the time of publication. The country specific values are not
  presented for these countries.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The countries with populations &lt; 250,000 and the 10 countries that do
  not produce estimates are not included in regional or global level estimates.
  For countries in which the estimates were not finalized at the time of
  publication, the unofficial best estimates are included in the regional and
  global values.</p>

  <p>Countries are providing with capacity building workshops every two years on
  the methods. In addition, they are supported by in country specialists in
  roughly 45 countries. Where no in country specialists are available remote
  assistance is provided. Guidelines are also available at: <a
