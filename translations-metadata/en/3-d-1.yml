  <p> </p>

  <p>Percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained at a
  specific point in time. The 13 core capacities are: (1) Legislation and
  financing; (2) IHR Coordination and National Focal Point Functions; (3)
  Zoonotic events and the Human-Animal Health Interface; (4) Food safety; (5)
  Laboratory; (6) Surveillance; (7) Human resources; (8) National Health
  Emergency Framework; (9) Health Service Provision; (10) Risk communication;
  (11) Points of entry; (12) Chemical events; (13) Radiation emergencies. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Core capacity:</strong> the essential public health capacity that
  States Parties are required to have in place throughout their territories
  pursuant to Articles 5 and 12, and Annex 1A of the IHR (2005) requirements by
  the year 2012. Thirteen core capacities and 24 indicators are defined in this
  document. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Indicator:</strong> a variable that can be measured repeatedly
  (directly or indirectly) over time to reveal change in a system. It can be
  qualitative or quantitative, allowing the objective measurement of the
  progress of a programme or event. The quantitative measurements need to be
  interpreted in the broader context, taking other sources of information (e.g.
  supervisory reports and special studies) into consideration and they should be
  supplemented with qualitative information. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Attributes:</strong> one of a set of specific elements or
  characteristics that reflect the level of performance or achievement of a
  specific indicator. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>The capability levels:</strong> Each attribute has been assigned a
  level of maturity, or a &#x2018;capability level.&#x2019; Attainment of a
  given capability level requires that all attributes at lower levels are in
  place. In the checklist, the status of core capacity development is measured
  at five capability levels, each of the 5 levels used is described by specific
  indicators, according related capacity. </p>

  <p>State Parties of IHR can use the on-line reporting tool, that reflects the
  questionnaire of the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool was published in
  July 2018 (all references and results published at: <a
  href="https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/"
  target="_blank"><u>https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/</u></a>. </p>

  <p>The tool consists of 24 indicators for the thirteen IHR capacities needed
  to detect, assess, notify, report and respond, including at points of entry,
  to public health risk and acute events of domestic and international concern.
  </p>

  <p>For each of the 13 capacities, one to three indicators are used to measure
  the status of each capacity. Each indicator is based on five cumulative levels
  for annual reporting. For each indicator, the reporting State Party is asked
  to select which of the five levels best describes the State Party&#x2019;s
  current status. For each indicator, in order to move to the next level, all
  capacities described in previous levels should be in place. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>WHO receives the data send by each State Party from the Official IHR
  National Focal Point from designated officers that will have access to e-SPAR
  restrict page for reporting on line and consult all national reports submitted
  in the e-SPAR database. </p>

  <p>After submission of data by each State Party, State Party and WHO IHR staff
  involved in the specific report will receive acknowledgement message from
  e-SPAR, with summary of information provided. </p>

  <p>WHO also will review data received at all level of the organization, using
  the e-SPAR platform for monitoring and evaluation of results, before final
  report to the World Health Assembly is produced and published. </p>

  <p>Breakdown of results can be done by country, WHO administrative Regions,
  Capacities and its indicators. All data recorded safely in e-SPAR platform.

  <p>Data collection for 2019 currently is under way. Deadline for completed

  <p>The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted in 2005 and
  entered into force in 2007 (available at: <a

  ) . </p>

  <p>Under the IHR, States Parties are obliged to develop and maintain minimum
  core capacities for surveillance and response, including at points of entry,
  in order to early detect, assess, notify, and respond to any potential public
  health events of international concern. </p>

  <p>Article 54 of the IHR request that States Parties and the Director-General
  shall report to the World Health Assembly on the implementation of these
  Regulations as decided by the World Health Assembly. </p>

  <p>In 2008, the World Health Assembly, through the adoption of Resolution
  WHA61(2), and later on 2018 with the Resolution WHA71(15), decided that
  &#x201C;that States Parties and the Director-General shall continue to report
  annually to the Health Assembly on the implementation of the International
  Health Regulations (2005), using the self-assessment annual reporting
  tool&#x201D;. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>This SDG 3.d.1. indicator reflects the capacities State Parties of the
  International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) had agreed and committed to
  develop. </p>

  <p>2) The questionnaire was revised in 2018 and been used for reporting in
  2018 and 2019 with same format, different from the questionnaire used during
  period from 2010-2017, thus there is limitation for comparison of scores from
  reports between 2010-2017 period with reports after 2018. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>INDICATOR LEVEL </p>

  <p>The score of each indicator level will be classified as a percentage of
  performance along the &#x201C;1 to 5&#x201D; scale. e.g. for a country
  selecting level 3 for indicator 2.1, the indicator level will be expressed as:
  3/5*100=60% </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>CAPACITY LEVEL </p>

  <p>The level of the capacity will be expressed as the average of all
  indicators. e.g. for a country selecting level 3 for indicator 2.1 and level 4
  for indicator 2.2. Indicator level for 2.1 will be expressed as: 3/5*100=60%,
  indicator level for 2.2 will be expressed as: 4/5*100=80% and capacity level
  for 2 will be expressed as: (60+80)/2=70% </p>

  <p>Since 2010 all 196 State Parties of IHR had at least once provided data for
  IHR Annual Reports/indicator SDG 3.d.1. Previous year, in 2018, 183 States had
  provided data using e-SPAR report format that was published, regarding this
  indicator. It was the highest number since 2010. For ongoing period 2019, as
  of 06 February 2020 we have received 100 reports </p>
