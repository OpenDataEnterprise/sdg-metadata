  <p>The Suicide mortality rate as defined as the number of suicide deaths in a
  year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 100 000. </p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: ''
CLASS_SYSTEM: ''
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p> The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete
  coverage and medical certification of cause of death, coded using the
  international classification of diseases (ICD). The ICD-10 codes for suicide
  are: X60-X84, Y87.0. Other possible data sources include household surveys
  with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies
  and surveillance systems. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its
  cause-of-death estimates. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>WHO sends an e-mail two times per year requesting tabulated death
  registration data (including all causes of death) from Member States.
  Countries submit annual cause-of-death statistics to WHO on an ongoing basis.

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures of the world. The most
  prevalent of these disorders are depression and anxiety, which are estimated
  to affect nearly 1 in 10 people. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide.
  In 2012, there were over 800,000 estimated suicide deaths worldwide. Suicide
  was the second leading cause of deaths among young adults aged 15&#x2013;29
  years, after road traffic injuries. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p> The complete recording of suicide deaths in death-registration systems
  requires good linkages with coronial and police systems, but can be seriously
  impeded by stigma, social and legal considerations, and delays in determining
  cause of death. Less than one half of WHO Member States have well-functioning
  death-registration systems that record causes of death. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Suicide mortality rate (per 100,000 population) = (Number of suicide deaths
  in a year x 100,000) / Mid-year population for the same calendar year </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of
  data available from countries: </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including
  information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states
  submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where
  necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death
  estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with
  verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and

  <p>For countries with high-quality cause-of-death statistics,
  interpolation/extrapolation was done for missing country-years; for countries
  with only low-quality or no data on causes of death, modelling was used.

COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Around 70 countries currently provide WHO with regular high-quality data on
  mortality by age, sex and causes of death, and another 40 countries submit
  data of lower quality. However, comprehensive cause-of-death estimates are
  calculated by WHO systematically for all of its Member States (with a certain
  population threshold) every 3 years. </p>

  <p>Sex, age group </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>In countries with high quality vital registration systems, point estimates
  sometimes differ primarily for two reasons: 1) WHO redistributes deaths with
  ill-defined cause of death (i.e. injuries of unknown intent, ICD codes Y10-Y34
  and Y872) to suicide; and 2) WHO corrects for incomplete death registration.
