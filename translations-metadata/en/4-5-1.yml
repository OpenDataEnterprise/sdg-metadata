  <p>Target 4.5: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure
  equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the
  vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and

  <p>Indicator 4.5.1: Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top
  wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and
  conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on
  this list that can be disaggregated</p>

  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They
  represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other.
  Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A
  value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>See metadata for relevant underlying indicator.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>To measure the general level of disparity between two sub-populations of
  interest with regard to a given indicator. The further from 1 the parity index
  lies, the greater the disparity between the two groups of interest.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator is not symmetrical about 1 but a simple transformation can
  make it so (by inverting ratios that exceed 1 and subtracting them from 2).
  This will make interpretation easier.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by
  the indicator value of the other sub-population of interest. </p>

  <p>DPI = [Indi]d</p>

  <p>[Indi]a</p>

  <p>where:</p>

  <p>DPI = the Dimension (Gender, Wealth, Location, etc.) Parity Index</p>

  <p>Indi = the Education 2030 Indicator i for which an equity measure is
  needed.</p>

  <p>d = the likely disadvantaged group (e.g. female, poorest, etc.)</p>

  <p>a = the likely advantaged group (e.g. male, richest, etc.)</p>
