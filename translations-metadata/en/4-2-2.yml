  <h2><strong><strong>Definition:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>The participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official
  primary entry age), by sex as defined as the percentage of children in the
  given age range who participate in one or more organized learning programme,
  including programmes which offer a combination of education and care.
  Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both included.
  The age range will vary by country depending on the official age for entry to
  primary education.</p>

  <h2><strong><strong>Concepts:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>An organized learning programme is one which consists of a coherent set or
  sequence of educational activities designed with the intention of achieving
  pre-determined learning outcomes or the accomplishment of a specific set of
  educational tasks. Early childhood and primary education programmes are
  examples of organized learning programmes. </p>

  <p>Early childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of
  the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). Early
  childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support
  children&#x2019;s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development
  and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family
  context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed
  to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and
  mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding
  core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a
  basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation. </p>

  <p>The official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to
  start primary education according to national legislation or policies. Where
  more than one age is specified, for example, in different parts of a country,
  the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most children in the
  country are expected to start primary) is used for the calculation of this
  indicator at the global level.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2><strong><strong>Description:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Administrative data from schools and other centres of organized learning or
  from household surveys on enrolment by single year of age in early learning
  programmes; population censuses and surveys for population estimates by single
  year of age (if using administrative data on enrolment); administrative data
  from ministries of education on the official entrance age to primary
  education.</p>

  <h2><strong><strong>Collection process:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics produces time series based on enrolment
  data reported by Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices and
  population estimates produced by the UN Population Division. The enrolment
  data are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education. Countries are
  asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in the
  International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure
  international comparability of resulting indicators.</p>

  <p>The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems
  that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for
  implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives
  reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations
  given (of implausible but correct results). During this process countries are
  also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.</p>

  <p>In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the
  main indicators the UIS produces in an annual &#x201C;country review&#x201D;
  of indicators.</p>

  <h2><strong><strong>Rationale:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>The indicator measures children&#x2019;s exposure to organized learning
  activities in the year prior to the start of primary school. A high value of
  the indicator shows a high degree of participation in organized learning
  immediately before the official entrance age to primary education</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2><strong><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Participation in learning programmes in the early years is not full time
  for many children, meaning that exposure to learning environments outside of
  the home will vary in intensity. The indicator measures the percentage of
  children who are exposed to organized learning but not the intensity of the
  programme, which limits the ability to draw conclusions on the extent to which
  this target is being achieved. More work is needed to ensure that the
  definition of learning programmes is consistent across various surveys and
  defined in a manner that is easily understood by survey respondents, ideally
  with complementary information collected on the amount of time children spend
  in learning programmes.</p>

  <h3>Methodology</h3>

  <h2><strong><strong>Computation method:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>The number of children in the relevant age group who participate in an
  organized learning programme is expressed as a percentage of the total
  population in the same age range. The indicator can be calculated both from
  administrative data and from household surveys. If the former, the number of
  enrolments in organized learning programmes are reported by schools and the
  population in the age group one year below the official primary entry age is
  derived from population estimates. For the calculation of this indicator at
  the global level, population estimates from the UN Population Division are
  used. If derived from household surveys, both enrolments and population are
  collected at the same time.</p>

  <p>PROL0t1,AG(a-1) = E0t1,AG(a-1)</p>

  <p>SAPAG(a-1)</p>

  <p>where:</p>

  <p>PROL0t1,AG(a-1) = participation rate in organized learning one year before
  the official entry age a to primary education</p>

  <p>E0t1,AG(a-1) = enrolment in early childhood or primary education (ISCED
  levels 0 and 1) aged one year below the official entry age a to primary
  education</p>

  <p>SAPAG(a-1) = school-age population aged one year below the official entry
  age a to primary education</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <h2><strong><strong>Treatment of missing values:</strong></strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The UIS estimates certain key items of data that may be missing or
  incomplete in order to have publishable estimates at the country level. Where
  this is not possible the UIS imputes missing values for use only for
  calculating regional and global aggregates.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of calculating participation rates by age, the UIS may
  make one or more of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An adjustment to account for over- or under-reporting, for example:</li>
    <li> To include enrolments in a type of education &#x2013; such as private education or special education &#x2013; not reported by the country; and/or </li>
    <li> To include enrolments in a part of the country not reported by the country.</li>
    <li>An estimate of the number of enrolments in the given age group if the age distribution was not reported by the country</li>
    <li>A redistribution of enrolments of unknown age (across known ages)</li>
    <li>An estimate of the population in the official age group for small countries (if neither the UN Population Division nor the country itself can provide estimates of their own).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In all cases estimates are based on evidence from the country itself (eg
  information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via
  correspondence, publications or data on the Ministry&#x2019;s or National
  Statistical Office&#x2019;s Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other
  organizations) or on data from the country for a previous year. These figures
  may be published: (i) as observed data if the missing items are found in a
  national source; (ii) as national estimates if the country is persuaded to
  produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data; or (iii) as UIS
  estimates, if the estimates are made by the UIS.</p>

  <p>The age distribution of enrolments is most commonly estimated from the age
  distribution reported in a previous year. If the country has never reported
  the age distribution of enrolments, the age distribution reported in another
  survey, if available, is used (such as Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
  (MICS) or Demographic Health Surveys (DHS)).</p>

  <p>Enrolments of unknown age are redistributed across known ages if they
  constitute more than 5% of the total enrolments in that level of education. No
  estimation is made if they are 5% or less.</p>

  <p>Population estimates by age for countries with small population &#x2013;
  produced only where there are no other suitable estimates available either
  from UNPD or from the country itself &#x2013; are made only for countries
  which have reported education data to the UIS and for which population
  estimates from a reliable source are available in some years.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Regional and global aggregates are derived from both publishable and
  imputed national data. Publishable data are the data submitted to the UIS by
  Member States or the result of an explicit estimation made by the Institute
  based on pre-determined standards. In both cases, these data are sent to
  Member States for review before they are considered publishable by the UIS.
  </p>

  <p>When data are not available for all countries, the UIS imputes national
  data for the sole purpose of calculating regional averages. These imputed data
  are not published nor otherwise disseminated. </p>

  <p>Where data are available for a country for both an earlier and a more
  recent year than the missing year, a simple linear interpolation is made.
  Where data are only available for an earlier year, the most recent value is
  used as an estimate. Similarly, where data are only available for a more
  recent year, the last value is used as an estimate.</p>

  <p>Where the relevant data are not available at all for a country, estimates
  may be based on another variable which is clearly linked to the item being
  estimated. For example, enrolments by age may be based on total
  enrolments.</p>

  <p>Where no data are available for the country in any year that can inform the
  estimate, the unweighted average for the region in which the country lies is
  used.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <h2><strong><strong>Regional aggregates:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Regional and global aggregates are calculated as weighted averages using
  the denominator of the indicator as the weight. As described previously, where
  publishable data are not available for a given country or year, values are
  imputed for the purpose of calculating the regional and global aggregates.</p>

  <h2><strong><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>By age and sex from administrative sources, and by age, sex, location and
  income from household surveys. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2><strong><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Nationally-published figures may differ from the international ones because
  of differences between national education systems and the International
  Standard Classification of Education (ISCED); or differences in coverage (i.e.
  the extent to which different types of education &#x2013; e.g. private or
  special education &#x2013; are included in one rather than the other) and/or
  between national and the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) population
  estimates.</p>
