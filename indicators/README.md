# Indicators

This folder is used to store the Microsoft Word authoring template for each indicator. When any Word file is uploaded or updated here, a pull-request will be generated to convert the change into source translation (*.pot) files.

**This folder holds all tier 1 indicators (excluding pilot indicators).** For available tier 2 indicators, see subdirectory sdg-metadata/indicators T2/...

All files **must** be named according to the indicator id, using dashes. For example:

* 1-1-1.docx
* 1-2-1.docx
* etc...
